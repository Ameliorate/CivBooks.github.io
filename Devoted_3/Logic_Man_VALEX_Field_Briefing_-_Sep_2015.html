Today's threat level is: HIGH

The state of the server is deteriorating. Atrophy infection has reached critical levels.

Border areas in the north and south have</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">suffered the worst contamination, and no longer support the livelihoods of any players.

Intra-regional areas are dangerously contaminated, but contain the majority of the server’s ‘active’ settlements.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Endless cycles of raiding and civil unrest have left these sectors in a state of social collapse.

Rogue attacks from disaffected players have spiked in activity, and Eden has been unwilling, or unable, to respond.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Nox operates virtually unchallenged in these zones, taking advantage of the chaos to recruit members and disguise their military infrastructure.

In recent cycles, Nox
(previously known as
Libertas) has been suspiciously quiet,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">with little terrorist activity.

However, observed actions include:

• expansionary behaviour into disenfranchised nations;

• high volume investment in global</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">trade markets; and

• aggressive manipulation of international mass media.

These efforts are suspected to be funded by Nox's apparent access to vast diamond deposits.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">At this time, there are still several nations that remain unscarred by outbreaks of Atrophy.

These core settlements are considered to be the most active and functional population centres, and are under the protection</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">of Eden, a serverwide defence force.

Netherfactory transport connections serve as critical lifelines for these areas.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">░ Risk Reduction
   Measures

VALEX shareholders are advised to remain outwardly neutral with regards to Eden and
Nox, however it is worth noting that the current success of Nox has opened several potentially lucrative trade</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">vectors with both Nox itself and the Eden Defence Group.

Areas of the map that are severely affected by Atrophy provide little opportunity for profitable ventures or resource exploitation.

Furthermore, they</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">remain politically sensitive entities, particularly with regards to the interests of existing quadrant alliances.

Shareholders are advised to consolidate assets in core settlements for the next financial quarter.</div></div>
