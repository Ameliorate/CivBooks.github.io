Asda123 and Sappla1 in
Minister lounge.

Sappla1: This has too
much risk!
Asda123: The bigger
the risk...
Sappla1: I am just
afraid we will ruin it.
Our hides shall hang,

you have such faith in
such odds?
Asda123: I've had a
good history with
Eeatz, sheesh...
When I was just
starting out here, I was
robbed. I've had such
good friends here, and
quotes...
He came to my aide

We bonded. After, I
vowed to protect
and serve any friend

Sappla1: Loyalty like

I've never liked corps...

"for profit".
I don't care for what
we have, honestly.
We don't care for the
people who live here!
They came to us to

Asda123: What if it is
fair, and not

Sappla1: It can happen,
it just won't be as
good.
Asda123: How can you
tell?
Sappla1: Well...

Sappla1: I see....
Asda123: Question is,

Sappla1: Really?
Asda123: You have
