 How I Became Boss


     written by
       Greenkitten</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 30</a><div class="page-content">This story begins in a sleepy little village not too far from here called Persepolis. A wonderful town build of stone and wood. A hearty town with a good thick broth. A wonderful town full of hope and imagination, where the bees go to sleep.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 30</a><div class="page-content">This little town found its way on the world stage and with it the community grew, and grew, and grew, and 
it was pretty good and shit but then like some bad things happened.
But you don't want to hear about that do you?
Yes - pg 5
No - pg 4</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Good. The bad part of the story is the interesting part but I dunno, if you don't want to read about the bad things I don't blame you.
Hear enough of that shit in real life, y'know?
Bugger that.

the end</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Oh? So you wanted to read the bad part of the story?
Why?
Do you find pleasure in other's misfortunes? That's not cool. Maybe you should go to a head doctor and get your self sorted out.
No I mean it. Go get fixed then come back.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 30</a><div class="page-content">But to continue on with the story....


I once was a superior individual. I had the money, I had the women and I had the power. All my desires in life were fulfilled. But then the event happened.

...  ... ..... ..... !</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content">The smell of dog piss dribbling down my leg, sparked a sudden inspiration.

What if I just did the thing I was supposed to do from the start?

A powerful question mind you, but not one I was going to answer.

Too much for me...</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content">But there is this one thing I can tell you.

Its that there was nothing for this town to do, nothing for its people to excel in, nothing to become. 

So they did it. And exploded many things. From the government to the structures.
Even the bins.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">  Have you ever witnessed that? The power of pure destruction, malice and freedom?
A culmination of all that is rotten. Not written. Imagining this is beyond words. And I will tell you with all my vocabulary. Its just that.
Becoming boss was hard.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content">The task at hand was to write a simple guide. Nothing for those well versed in the written word. But for someone of my stature....
Broken, beaten and utterly incoherant. It was serving to be an awkward yet satisfying moment.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Nothing that another few lines couldn't ease. 

This task was easier than imagined. But still a due diligence was needed.
Overcoming an excessive use of aqua text, only in the minds of champions could one wish to achieve this.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Still to best my foes it was best for all of us to strive, to continue for that fleeting shot at glory. Poets and prophets would speak of this day like any other, but those in tune with the essence of nature would understand where we were coming from.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">It was a struggle all too real.
But for and impressive person with a secret plan it was as easy as slicing bread.

You will need:
   1/2 cup soy
   3 tbspn sugar
   8 apricots
   and spice to taste</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Step 1:
Mix it all in a bowl
Step 2:
Preheat over on 200 degrees (Whether that be celcius, foreignheit or angles, your choice)
Step 3:
Insert bowl
Step 4:
Wait.
Wait.
Wait:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Basically if you want to be successful, rich, full of friends and just generally be a lovable scoundrel then all you have to do is fund various terrorist activities.
Do NOT employ petty theives. They will ruin you and your buisiness. Not a joke.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Stand up for the rights of man. Do not allow any sort of slavery or even indentured servitude. A gaol sentence that does not end, cannot be permitted. Freedom for all, no matter what the cost.

Taxes shall not be paid until this happens.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">And that is the story of how I became boss. 

Basically just don't do anything until I tell you to do it.
I am the BOSS and I will tell you when you can do the things you should be doing shall be done.
Don't mistake this for kindness. Its just fact.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Me? I am just a simple man that had simple dreams. I did not ask to become the last and least respected member of the community. I just did what had to be done. I am a free agent, ready to be picked up at any time. No need for fear or regret.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content">We did it.
No truth to those words, it was just a mantra. But something we could respect and deal with in our own time. MEasures were taken for it not to become a reality.
But our spines were ground to dust, and it was let to happen without us.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">



  I expected more of you.
    Though I saw this happening before my eyes. Nothing to be sad about.
     I did love you at some point, but now? 
      Nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Sorry kid.

Its more than I ever asked for. But we did good together.

Thank you for all the memories. It was not wasted time, believe me. We have grown as human beings. We have found ourselves in this ruin. Don't cry.
We will return. Soon.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 30</a><div class="page-content">I interrupt this gibberish with a word from my sponsor.

>>>School is fucking gay and shit and boring and boring and gay and fucking I hate all my teachers they are fat lonely faggots wow they are so gay, i hate my dad<<<<

And now go back.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Please pass on this special message.

Don't forget to smell the earlobes of your marriage partner, sometimes you mightn't always like what you smell.

Thank you reader, but really I must go.
 Thank you
   Thank you.</div></div>
