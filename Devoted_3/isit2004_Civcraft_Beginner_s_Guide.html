CivCraft?
"Civcraft is an
experiment for
communities, political
ideologies, debate and
discussion.... where
players can work
together to create
and shape civilization
or to watch it
crumble."

<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Where am I?
Anyone who hasn't
slept in a bed yet
spawns at a random
point in the world.
You're most likely in
the middle of nowhere.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Why are so few
people in chat right
now?
Your chat range is
limited by distance.
This range varies
depending which shard
you're in but the
default is 750 blocks.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    How do I find
people?
Your best bet is to
respawn.
You can also poke
around on
reddit.com/r/Civcraft
for directions to a
city. There are usually
towns on there who
are looking for new
members.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Or, why not grab a few
friends and start a
town of your own? No
one's stopping you.
Although if you're
patient, maybe you
want to find a road
and, well, just see
where it takes you.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Are you an

No.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    How do I play?
Civcraft is a Minecraft
survival server in
which players are
more-or-less free to
do whatever they want.
Building, stealing,
fighting, killing, and
griefing are all fair
game.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Moderators only get
involved when someone
has cheated, hacked,
exploited a glitch, or
harassed another
player in real life.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">In Civcraft, power lies
with the players, not
the moderators.

power and to expand
some on Minecraft's
base feature set, the
following modifications
on the original
Minecraft are run on
Civcraft.

This mod lets players
imprison (and
effectively ban) each
other. To imprison
someone with Prison
Pearl simply kill them
while an ender pearl is
in your hotbar.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Citadel:
This mod allows
players to place
'reinforced' blocks
that are more difficult
to break than
non-reinforced
blocks. To make a
basic reinforcement,
type '/ctr' into chat
and then punch the
target block with
stone.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Bastion:
'Bastion' blocks
prohibit nearby
players from placing
blocks, emptying
buckets and throwing
ender pearls. In
practice they are
much less common than
reinforcements for
their expense and
specialized nature.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">    Juke Alert:
Jukeboxes and
noteblocks are
Civcraft's security
cameras. By simply
reinforcing a jukebox
or noteblock you turn
it into a 'snitch' that
keeps you updated on
what happens around
it.

The Pylon mod disables
standard Minecraft
experience-gathering
and enchantment. All
enchanted materials
on Civcraft come from
'Pylons' which are
rare and difficult to
build.

Build a house, build a
village, build a store,
build a castle, build an
island, build a mountain.
You can build an island
in the sky and then
build a city on top of
it, but that's already
been done though.
