<div class="page"><a href="#page-1" id="page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 9</a><div class="page-content">There once was a Wizard named Ghent.

He was an old man.

Older than the dirt he walked on.

And he had an assistant.

The assistant's name, was tvman.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Ghent would tell tvman to wash up the magical tower every night, after all the experiments were done.

And tvman would scrub scrub scrub, from night til dawn, trying to get rid of the acid stains, the cobweb goo, the ghostly ectoplasm.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">But every morning, the Wizard Ghent would get up and say "tsk tsk tsk, another lazy effort tvman."

Tvman didn't like this, so he started plotting.

He'd kill the Wizard while he was asleep.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The first night he crept up to the top of the tower, went into the bedroom of the Wizard and put a dagger straight into his heart.

tvman spent the rest of the night celebrating, the Wizard was dead! 

But sure enoug, come morning...</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The Wizard walked in, and scolded tvman for not finishing cleaning up!

Tvman was astounded.

The second night, tvman tried smothering him.

Once the Wizard Ghent was no longer breathing, he went downstairs to party</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">But lo and behold, the very next morning, the Wizard was walking again!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">And so tvman gave up.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">And he killed himself.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The end.</div></div>
