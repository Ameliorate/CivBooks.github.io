I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">[Chorus:]
Hey, now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire. How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">[Chorus 2x]</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</div></div>
