<div class="page"><a href="#page-1" id="page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 5</a><div class="page-content">In the wheat fields of Marienburg, there stood a man
Desperate to earn his way into the Kool Kek Klan
Sitting on the ground he thought mighty hard
Writing, in his book, a little bard
Thats when an idea came into his head</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 5</a><div class="page-content">One that would make all the Redditors plea to be dead
He dipped his pen in ink and took a glance
Hoping that this would be the Channer's best chance
He began writing and smiling with glee
He stood in the field for minutes 10 times 3</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 5</a><div class="page-content">When he was done he looked around
Noticed that the entire time he made no sound
He looked down at his book and scratched his neck
Signed his book as The Gospel of Kek
The word of Kek brought Redditors fear
All of which refused to come near</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 5</a><div class="page-content">In the wheat fields of Marienburg, there stood a man
I would one day love to shake his hand
The man was quiet and somewhat odd
That man's name is Pkeod</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 5</a><div class="page-content">In honor of Pkeod

Your name will forever be remembered in Chan History.
Legends live forever.</div></div>
