The Building Act
The Snitch Act
The Crimes Act</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">In the next few pages I will go over the three acts  have just listed in detail.




BUILDING ACT
----------------></div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">THE BUILDING ACT

The Building Act gives every citizen the right to have a house, as long as it does not exceed 30 x 30 blocks. Things such as flower gardens that are outside the house are still considered part of the house, and therefore are</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">included when counting how big your house is. So, if someone built a 28 x 28 house, they would be fine, but if they added a 5 x 5 flower garden outside the house, the house would be 28 x 33 blocks, which would not be allowed. Also, all houses have to be</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">reinforced to a Vogelburg Group or to the citizen, and a house must have at least one side facing a road. Any sides of a house that face a road must also have a sign in front of it with the owner's name(s) on it. As for Community Buildings, they must</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">benefit the community or be for enjoyment of the community. In addition, they should be reinforced completely on the outside and mostly on the inside. If the Council of Ministers thinks you should be fined if you do not comply with the Building </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Act, then they have the power to fine you.






Snitch Act
----------------></div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">THE SNITCH ACT

The Snitch Act defines where, when, and why citizens can place snitches, as well as the punishments for breaking these rules.
In general, snitches must be well-hidden, reienforced to a Vogelburg Group, and have a meaningful</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">name. If someone wants to put a private snitch in their house, they must ask an official for permission to do so. 'An official' is defined as a member of the Council of Ministers or someone the Council of Ministers appoints for that specific purpose.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">THE CRIMES ACT

All offences are categorized into three types: Crimes, Misdemeanours, and Simple Offences. There are also three differant scales for punishment, where Scale 1 is the worst and Scale 3 is not nearly as bad. If the offence is a Crime, </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">your punishment could be one of the Scale 1 punishments. Misdemeanours give punishments on Scale 2, and Simple Offences give punishment on Scale 3. Scale 1 punishments include Exile and Imprisonment, while Scale 2 includes Exile and Imprisonment, </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 21</a><div class="page-content">but for less time, as well as Hard Labor.
Scale 3's punishments include Imprisonment and Hard Labor. Some examples of offences that range the Scales are murder, sharing secrets that jeopardize Vogelburg's or another nation's safety, urging someone else to</div></div>
