   Trade and Labor

       by Soulfur

-------------------</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">My name is Soulfur. I live in a town near the center of the map called Kazad Ankor.

When I first came to this place, I saw the dilapidated farm of wheat and some potatoes. A food shortage was present.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">As any helpful citizen should, I met the demand by building a cottage and tending to the crops.

I care for nothing but planting and harvesting the fruits of roots and grasses, and smashing the melons which sustain us.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The only other "civ" server on which I have played was Civcraft 3.0. I was excited for its release. I played for a while and lost interest towards the end of its lifespawn.

So frequently I noticed the same trend:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Those who are ambitious and seek great things... frequently fall, and always have a bad time.

Why not be like me, and enjoy the peaceful existence of a task that one knows helps those around him?</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I enjoy the gardens because for each block broken, and for each seed sown, one fragment of happiness is added to the group.

Indeed, all that must be done to "win" this game is the farming of these crops. Do not seek war, leadership, or political strife.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Please, for your own sake, join me in my laborious efforts.

Farm, mine, woodcut, fish, build... simply specialize.

Play not too much or too seriously or this will become a boredom.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">If the game is treated as a fun social setting, and you are respectful to those around you, and of course you enjoy the "menial labor," you will know the sheer fun that can be had just from breaking or placing a few blocks.

That is Minecraft, imo.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Regarding trade -

I have a ridiculous surplus of baked potatoes. A double chest, easily.

The same can be said for my wheat (hay bale) supply. And the carrots. Oh, the melons as well. Soon, sugar cane.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It is not my role as I am a simple farmer. As of this writing I own a shop in Mount Athos that sells crops, but more must work:

All must work to promote free and easy trade. I should not have a surplus of crops. Other need them.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It is difficult, and at the moment apparently impossible, to find a source through which I can peddle my edible products.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">To summarize:

Work hard.
Promote trade.

Thank you.
