+++++++++++++++++++

This books is based off of my experiences with the creatures found in this peninsula - Which belongs to me at the time of writing this book.

God bless us all.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I: Clouds
This may sound dumb, but the clouds in this place do appear to have intentions, specially in the high peaks of this place of chaos. Fog constantly covering every hole, ready to deceive the unwary to fall to maybe an inconvinient hole. </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Or a quick and fiery death, and do be wary of the colour of the clouds - When they take a dark, gray tone. You can assume that new vicious fiends are making their way to populate this island.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">II: Pigmen - Pig-Kids
Pigmen appear to have once been human, due to their shape, and them having enough decency to cover their loins. But I assure you, they are not even worthy to be compared to an actual pig anymore, lost, tortured souls. probably paying</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">for a previous life of sin and heresy. They do seem to have reproductive activities, as infant variants of these creatures can be found. But are quite rare, as the weaker infants are eaten by the stronger ones. Only the most vicious of infants making it</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">to adulthood.
There does seem to be a hierarchy inbetween packs of Pigmen. As usually they can be seen following a Pigmen with an enchanted sword.
Leadership seems to be delivered with birth, as I have seen infants already holding enchanted swords.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">These creatures are pushovers, even if vicious in large numbers. They are no threat to a decent fighter, and even then. You can avoid fighting them by just not attacking them first, they don't react to namecalling, bumping or staring.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">III: Burnt.
A demon taken straight from the Nether. Placed on the surface of earth to cause chaos and madness.
They seem to be lonely creatures, as it's rare to find more than 1 in a same day. But they're not to be under-estimated.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">They fire projectiles in quick succesion. So if not prepared, you can be taken down easily. After shooting, they go into a cooldown period, made evident by their flame going off and their height of levitation going lower. This time being optimal to attack</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">They're hostile creatures to anyone that isn't a fiend from the peninsula, and annoying as all hell. Do try to get rid of them, but with caution. Successfully taking one down grants a guaranteed blaze rod. So this place might be of interest to alchemists.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">IV: Ghasts.
By far the rarest of creatures on this island, ever since I came to own this land, I've only seen one. But from what I can gather, they're not dangerous at all as long as you have good reflexes. They can  be noticed by their muffled moaning.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">V: Slobber Witches
Cousins, sisters and nieces of the witches described in my book "Templar's Tale". They rely on potions both splash and regular to fight. When attacking usually throwing a slowness potion, followed by a posion potion</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">and then a damage one to finish you off.
When hit, they will quickly retreat to heal. Which is the best time to attack, assuming you can damage her faster than she can heal herself.
You can distinguish them by their nasty giggles when near.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">VI: ???-man
I've seen this creature only twice. And it seems to be quite dangerous, so I halted investigation, looks like a regular enderman, and doesn't have a name-tag to make himself stand out, but as soon as he gets attacked. He quickly reveals -</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">- His true colours, teleporting in a quick, frantic fashion. As if it were raining, only to strike you from behind as soon as they get the chance.
They're vicious, and dangerous, they're not to be sparred with unless you know you'll win.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">And if you don't think so, just avoid them, don't look at them, don't bump into them, don't come near them. And they'll do nothing to you aswell.
There's no way to distinguish one of these with a regular enderman as far as I can tell.</div></div>
