<div class="page"><a href="#page-1" id="page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 3</a><div class="page-content">Once upon a time, there was a ship which elegantly hovered over the crystal-clear ocean waves. 

The sea had thrown everything against the ship, but despite this, it had survived.

This was about to change.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 3</a><div class="page-content">A menacing, blue squid with the name of "TTK2" emerged from the clouded waters - barnacled and aggressive. 

It took a swing at the ship, but the ship staggered backwards, and continued sailing towards its destination.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 3</a><div class="page-content">The fear on the crews faces were evident, as the squid kept doing shit that they didn't like.

Then it turned out the destination was the squids mouth, so it got eaten the whole time and died.

THE END</div></div>
