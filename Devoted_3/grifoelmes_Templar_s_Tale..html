By: grifoelmes
++++++++++++++++++
This book tells a loose rendition of my journey to the Novo Blyat peninsula, to commit my goal. Evangelization of the lands, just as the lord would like it.

+Deus Vult+</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter I: Departure.
It was early in the morning, sun shining in the sky. As our hero grifoelmes, from his bed he did rise.

He looked through the window, heavens so blue above, knowing that of his deeds. History would be made part of.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">He got his equipment ready! Pickaxe, sword and sturdy shield. For this journey, nor his soul nor his armour could yield.

He stepped out into the world, vicious and un-kind. But his objective was set, he wouldn't change his mind.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter II: The Journey

The travel itself, was on it's own right. Unrelenting, vicious, dangerous, turning back seemed quite tempting.
But there was no turning back, not for our hero anymore, his mind was set on representing our God.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The walks were long and harsh, the journeys on the sea dangerous and unknown. But in the end, great tales of his deeds had to be unfold.
And so, with determination, and maybe desperate madness, but he eventually made it, to this place of sadness.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter III: Arrival.
It was late in the evening as our hero's boat washed ashore, this place's madness could not be ignored.
Water and lava, both together as if brethren, the clouds themselves covering this wasteland so barren.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Our hero laid a bed, a small camp at the peak of the mountain.

"There's a new inhabitant here, just one, but still counting!"

These words having been said, the work had begun - The foundations to a chruch, a place of prayer and nuns.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter IV: Conflict.

A week had gone by, the peninsula unrelenting, sending vicious fiends, beasts. Evilness fermenting.

The land rejected our hero, his every step unsettling this ancient earth, a land of madness. Were chaos was given birth.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"Even if difficult, rough, and unruly. I will win, for my faith is truly!"
Our hero was determined, but the island even more, the horde of fiends present, made living here a chore.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">But the island came to realize, brute force was useless. To defeat our hero. It would be in cleverness that it would have to be rootless.

And so, the fiends came to a stop, our hero calmly bulding the chapel, refuge and crops.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter V: Trickery.

The island was governed, by 2 witches so foul - just thinking about our hero's righteousness made them growl.

"What should we do?" The elder one said.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"I think we should burn him with nickel and lead!"

"That's quite the good idea, truth to be told - But I think we should go for something not as bold."

"So what should we do then, to this righteous shmuck?"</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"I know what to do, it'll end with his luck." 

The foul witches shared a nasty laughter, the banishment of the hero would come soon after.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter VI: Poison.

They came to the hero, disguised with wisdom so kind, offering a drink - To the youngster in his prime.

They told him it was fine, it would help with his luck! That it wouldn't cause him any kind of 'yuck'.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The hero took a sip, and then a quick chug. Completely oblivious to the fact that he was being drugged.

He fell to the floor, Paralyzed and useless, to the witches his life being worthless.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"What should we do with him?" The elder one asked again.

But before the other could answer, it began to rain.
The sky became black, the rain thick as clay, as a deep booming voice spoke towards they.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"Don't even think about it. You couple of fowl whores." 
And who was it talking? Gasp. It was our lord!

Before the witches could answer, talk or run away. A powerful thunder turning the witches to clay.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The hero didn't even realize the glory of his lord, his eyes too busy with the drug's coloured galore.

"You have served me well, my dear little kid - Do live as you wish, as in heaven we will eat of the same dish."

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">And that being said, the rain went away. Our hero's sight slowly turning gray.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter VII: Departure.

It was now morning, the heavens were clear - Our hero rose up, the time of departure was near.

The chapel was built, the roads were broomed. He took his things, and went back home, not knowing of his early near-doom.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 22</a><div class="page-content">And so, with glory and pride I wrote this book, so it won't be forgotten what effort it took - To build that chapel, roads and what else. But don't worry my friends, and fasten your belts. My deeds are far from done, there's work to be done.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Even if this book's contents are now far away gone.
