While digging in the land around Mt. Athos, I discove-
red an old stone chest encased in tree roots. I brought the chest back with me; the lock crumbled in my hand. Within the chest was a lone book, its cover rather worn;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">it sat upon dust and flakes of leather, perhaps wrappings of some sort when it was first buried.

The pages within the tome were faded, but legible, and I recognized the language as a dead tongue from centuries before. I had studied it once, hoping to</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">understand the complexities of their civilization, and had never expected to see the runes again when I was done. 

I painstakingly translated what follows into the language we use today; there appear to have been nine 'chapters' of sorts.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">i.
In the south of Hara, I
came upon a hill in a dark
    wood
bereft of tree or living
    creature.

Rather, there were trees
    destroyed,
and bones ground to dust;
for the hill was cloaked
in the coils of a great
    Serpent,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">his scales aglow beneath the
    moon.

Smooth onyx were his eyes,
    with
round white pupils like a
    blind man's --
human eyes inverted --
and in these pale circles was
    inscribed</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">the sign of Death, relic of
    ancient magics lost.

Lost, too, would I have been;
dead, in the endless void --
were not my eyes bearers
of the same Sign.

Thus I looked upon the
    Basilisk,
and matches his gaze,
and lived.</div></div>

{note: ii was missing}

So cloaked in the
Serpent's scales and bones
was the Wanderer,
Akhi'aleph's chosen;
power dwelt within his veins.

By his breath
did the dead scream their
    horror.
By his footsteps,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">did the stones crack and
    crumble.
By his bladeswings
did the trees sway in
    reverence.

And the daylight hours,
ever fearing his illumination,
did pass more quickly --
so the days shortened.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">That ancient Hill, once lush,
grew barren and cold in the 
    shade;
and each night
it pierced the sky ever deeper,
that the Wanderer,
Akhi'aleph's chosen,
could by day
live hidden in its shadow.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">iv.
The snows that fell
on Serpent's Mountain
ceased to melt
in the cold darkness.

And the Wanderer,
Akhi'aleph's chosen,
hungered for the heat
of fresh bodies,
and descended the mountain
to seek them out.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">v.
Out from the mountain
did a great storm churn,
driving the nearby villages
    away,
that the Wanderer,
Akhi'aleph's cursed cruelty,
might go far from there.

Thus did the Wanderer roam
the world, hunting for
the flesh which might
sate his hunger.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Ahead of him
the winds whispered
in urgency --
"Akhi'aleph's chosen
roams the world
once more."</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">vi.
The fearful mortals
assembled in great numbers
in a cave outside their
    homelands,
aiming to hide.

The scent of their fear
lured the Wanderer there --
and the cave walls
ran red,
and the hills
rang with echoes of screams.</div></div>

The last three 'chapters' here seem to have been written in a different language than the one I know. I will try to translate them in another book, once I can figure out what script it is.</div></div>
