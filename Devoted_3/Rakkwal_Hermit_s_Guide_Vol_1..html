When first leaving city
life or joining a new
server with the intent
to live unaccompanied
it's necessary to have
formulated a plan.

Take into account the
worldmap, give
yourself an
approximation of how
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">and where you would
like to live.

Especially at the
launch of a server,
make your living space
meek, even hidden.
Dropchest anything of
value away from your
homestead. You can't
always be there to
defend your hard
earned items, and no

For Devoted
specifically, it is
desireable and
reccomended to obtain
a Smelter factory.
This cheap factory
has many useful tools
for crafting building
blocks, and the ever
important Claims
Bastion if you intend

As it becomes more
feasable and safe to
create a homestead or
decorative buildings
with minimal grief, a
tree farm and a
steady supply of
materials for your
Smelter become
important.
Self sufficiency comes

Being a hermit is
uneventful, and can
feel worn out fairly
quick without proper
motivation. To remain a
hermit til end game you
will need goals to keep
from stagnation.
Become automated,
build your own
ghost-town, travel and
</div></div>

wealth. Think of
something that you
feel comfortable with
in your playstyle.
Possiblities are
endless, just
brainstorm and it will
come to you.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">       Travelling

Having to travel is
usually inevitable if
you want to take
advantage of luxories
that cannot be
obtained through this
playstyle.

Many cities have a
public resource pool,
from Pickaxe factories

<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">to cheaply obtainable
tools through shops.
Gaining access to
public factories and
worspaces are usually
as simple as messaging
a member within the
town. While having to
speak to someone may
be unfortunate, it is
worth it.

When you are

carry the minimum. A
minecart and a spare,
a boat, and for long
journeys a bed.
Try not to stand out
by being heavily
geared, but don't go
anywhere unarmed or
naked. In both cases,
you will attract
unwanted attention.

For monitoring
purposes, you will
usually have the
advantage. You likely
wont have a large
claim, and therefore
wont have to create a
very complex snitch
grid.
Because you are less
likely to use noteblock

majority of your
network will be
Jukeboxes. Each
monitors a 3d cube
with a functional
radius of 11 blocks,
making it easy to
secure a large area.

can be set up with

After placing a Juke,
use command
"/jaToggleLevers 1"
to enable lever output.
The adjacent block a
lever is placed will
determine the input
required to toggle the
lever. Levers are only
toggled by players not
on the snitch group.
