<div class="page"><a href="#page-1" id="page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I sent you all to Satan
Sent you to the devil, decapitated
Splattered, degraded
Rather amazing matters of hatred
Manifestation
The cannibal data related to random standards in cases
Fuckin' faggots stabbed in they faces
Buckets of acid</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Hitchhike with truckers in traffic
I'm stuck on a path where the outcome is nothing but tragic
My outward appearance is nothing but average
Inside of my brain structrure the primary function is madness</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Torture these traitors
Put their blow torches to faces
Corpses in my basement

Killing you is refreshling and liberating
Playing with the dead is extensively titilating</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Humans are extremely expensive but really tasty
Sell you on the Black Market in pieces to anybody who pays me
Limited quantity
Culinary sodomy
Unique cuisine, delicacy
The ultimate equality</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I'm Ogrish
As vulgar as you can get
Cut out your vulva
My cult of the dead
Eats from your skull
Pulverize like a vulture's molars
My goal is dicing up Cindy Margolis
And placing her flesh on slices and servin' you hemoglobinisis</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Its priceless
I'm savage, artistic like the vampire of Paris
Sadistic
Start a campfire
Reminisce of massacres lifted
Blast through a pillow
I'm a sick bastard like Andre Chikatilo
Slay the padre
Watch the silhouette of a killer glow</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Dusted like Repka's artwork
Like Carcass' "Heartwork"
Like an aardvark searchin' through organs like carparts rockin' a Cardhardt
Ritual sacrifice is human appetizers
I capitilize on this cannibalism violence advertisements</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">My cypher of tyrants are trifer than pirates
Like lifers that killed wifey with knives
A violent viking's in Ice Age
Smacking Satan
Invading your crib like Patrick Bateman
With a hatchet waiting making a theatric statement</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">They call me Fondlecorpse

Cavin' in brains
That's what I call entertainment
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Anachronistic
Wit' two biscuits that clip through your discus
The gore grinder
Cause I'm down to the last 6 on my hit-list
I'm a sick kid
Pieces of skull and blood on my ticksis
Too much brown acid
Used to be in love with the business of killings</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">This vision is scalvaged for nothing
Venison victim
Buried face down
You're similar to a faggot who takes it in him
Basically a waste of skin
I've returned and sent him a telegram</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">A body count with two legs
Shattered next to the hexagram
I make like squeaky and stab it
My circle fam is supreme bandits
Murdered like speed handlers
Dirt on the canvas
Torso fuck shorter than Danzig</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Saw off your legs and walk on your hands like you was dancin'

You know the symptoms when the coughing begins</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">The prince of evil erupts
Cut you cunts into cutlets
You fuckin' faggot punks
A bunch of sluts that'll suck dick
We bust clips at cops
And trust kids with Glocks
We'll thrust in the ox of puss, drips and drops</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Rockin' bloody bone chains and veins
My cult's strange
Known to indulge in pain
Crack skulls, expose brains
While God's forsaken me there's carcass cooking in my bakery
Scraping off your skin and string it up my wall as drapery</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Dramatically battering you
Emphatically splattering you
Sporadically ravaging like a scavanger do
Sharpen claws
Ripped and tore your shit
You're dead and sure to twitch, bitch
Your blood and piss is pouring out of every orifice</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Corpse grisly and grim
I use my scissors to trim
The blue corset from the host
As I efficiently skin
Spin the record around
I chop your ventricles down
You'll see my tentacles found you
Now you enter the ground</div></div>
</div></body></html>
