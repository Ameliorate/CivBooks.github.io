Legend has it, that an old book can be found in the +,+ quadrant. Inside, there's a clue to a treasure map - one that leads to the treasure of Stampede The Great.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 2</a><div class="page-content">Legend also has it, there's an identical copy in the ruins of a great empire.
The books have a riddle which you must solve to get a clue to obtain the map.
However, it is a treacherous journey, for it is full of traps.
Good luck.</div></div>
