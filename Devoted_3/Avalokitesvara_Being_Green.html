<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It isn't easy being
green.

At least, not after
he came.

I have lived most of my
life in a dark cave,
only coming out at
night, occasionally
catching some rays
in the morning.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Life was great: the
"passives" kept to
themselves above
ground, and the
zombies and spiders
were my friends.
(Though eventually
you got tired of the
zombies' constant
groaning). Only
skeletons were a
bother, during their
archery sessions.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">I had seem some
distant relatives shot
down for "records".

One day, however,
things changed.

It started when the
zombies started
massing and coming
from everywhere.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It was night, and they
were all leaving the
cave. I thought that
this might be a village
raid, so I kept to
myself initially.
(I abhorred their
mindless killing and
infecting).
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">But I knew something
was wrong when I saw
that barely a tenth of
them had come back.
Surely the villagers
couldn't be killing them,
and there wasn't a
golem in the village. No,
it had to be something
else.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The next morning, I
peeked outside. I soon
saw the source of the
abnormality last night.
Beyond the skeletons
and zombies burning to
a crisp on the hillside,
I saw a house, though
one unlike those of
the villagers.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">For one thing, it was
made of dirt, and not
wood and stone.

For another, there
was a strange man
inside it.

He was unlike the
villagers - he had a
short face and small
nose, and wore a blue
shirt and pants.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">In his hands was a
pick axe, though
occasionally he would
swap this tool at
incredible speed for
another, such as a
shovel or sword.

As I watched, he left
the house, and began
walking towards the
cave, pick axe in hand.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">I quickly slunk back
into a corner, wanting
to observe this
mysterious new visitor.

He entered the cave,
placing torches on the
wall as he went. Like
the villagers,
this man was afraid
of the dark.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It was soon clear why:
as he walked, zombies,
skeletons and spiders
came out of their
recesses with
incredible
determination, all
trying to punch, shoot,
or jump on him. In
response, he pulled
out a sword, and
began hacking at
these monsters.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Despite their efforts
to stay alive, one by
one they were cut
down, with only some
effort on the man's
part. At that point, I
realized that we
were up against a
fearsome foe.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">I decided to follow him
as he descended
further into the cave,
quietly following. I had
to admire the care he
took in clearing his
path: he laid down
dozens of torches,
and used dirt to
bridge his way across
ravines.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Soon, we were near
the bottom of the
world. Along the way,
he had been hacking
at minerals and ores
with his pick axe.
Clearly these were
valuable to him in some
way. At one point, his
pick axe snapped into
pieces upon hitting the
rock;
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">somehow he produced
a wooden box, like
those in the village,
which in turn produced
a brand new pick axe.

At one point he turned
to the cave's solid
side, and began
hacking away at it.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Eventually, he stopped,
and came back with a
rough blue diamond in
hand. He carried it with
pride.

It was then that I felt
a great feeling come
over me, an
indescribable feeling
of fury at this man,
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">who had such love for
such material objects.
We mobs got by walking
about peacefully in
our dark caves, and
now this intruder was
killing off my friends
and rendering this
cave uninhabitable for
some, only for his self
gain.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">I ran at him, and as I
did, my anger became
an audible sizzling. The
last sight I saw was of
the man, desperately
hacking at me, with a
face of pure terror.

BOOM
