Earendil was
a mariner
that tarried
in Arvernien;

he built a boat
of timber felled
in Nimbrethil
to journey in;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
her sails he wove
of silver fair,
of silver were
her lanterns made,

her prow was
fashioned
like a swan
and light upon
her banners laid.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
In panolpy of
ancient kings,
in chained rings
he armoured him;

his shining shield
was scored
with runes
to ward all wounds
and harm from him;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
his bow was made
of dragon-horn,
his arrows shorn
of ebony;

of silver was
his habergeon,
his scabbard
of chalcedony;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
his sword of steel
was valient,
of adamant
his helmet tall,

an eagle-plume
upon his crest,
upon his breast
an emerald.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
Beneath the Moon
and under star
he wandered far
from northern strands,

bewildered on
enchanted ways
beyond the days
of mortal lands.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
From gnashing of
the Narrow Ice
where shadow lies
on frozen hills,

from nether heats
and burning waste
he turned in haste,
and roving still</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
on starless waters
far astray
at last he came
to Night of Naught,

and passed,
and never
sight he saw
of shining shore
nor light he sought.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
The winds of wrath
came driving him,
and blindly in
the foam he fled

from west to east
and errandless,
unheralded he
homeward sped.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
There flying Elwing
came to him,
and flame was in
the darkness lit;

more bright than
light of diamond
the fire on her
carcanet.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
The Silmaril
she bound on him
and crowned him
with the living light,

and dauntless then
with burning brow
he turned his prow;
and in the night</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
from otherworld
beyond the Sea
there strong and free
a storm arose,

a wind of power
in Tarmenel;
by paths that seldom
mortal goes</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
his boat it bore
with biting breath
as might of death
across the grey

and long forsaken
seas distressed;
from east to west
he passed away.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
Thought Evernight
he back was borne
on black and roaring
waves that ran

o'er leagues unlit
and foundered shores
that drowned before
the Days began,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
until he hears
on strands of pearl
where end the world
the music long,

where ever-foaming
billows roll
the yellow gold
and jewels wan.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
He saw the Mountain
silent rise
where twilight lies
upon the knees

of Valinor,
and Eldamar
beheld afar
beyond the seas.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
A wanderer
escaped from night
to haven white
he came at last,

to Elvenhome
the green and fair
where keen the air,
where pale as glass</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
beneath the
Hill of Ilmarin
a-glimmer in
a valley sheer

the lamplit towers
of Tirion
are mirrored
on the Shadowmere.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
He tarried there
from errantry,
and melodies they
taught to him,

and sages old
him marvels told,
and harps of gold
they brought to him.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
They clothed him then
in elven-white,
and seven lights
before him sent,

as through
the Calacirian
to hidden land
forlorn he went.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
He came unto
the timeless halls
where shining fall
the countless years,

and endless reigns
the Elder King
in Ilmarin
on Mountain sheer;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
and words unheard
were spoken then
of folk and Men
and Elven-kin,

beyond the world
were visions showed
forbid to those
that dwell therein.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-24" id="page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
A ship then new
they built for him
of mithril and
of elven glass

with shining prow;
no shaven oar
nor sail she bore
on silver mast:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
the Silmaril
as lantern light
and banner bright
with living flame

to gleam thereon
by Elbereth
herself was set,
who thither came</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-26" id="page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
and wings immortal
made for him,
and laid on him
undying doom,

to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the Sun and light
of Moon.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
From Evergreen's
lofty hills
where softly silver
fountains fall

his wings him bore,
a wandering light,
beyond the mighty
Mountain Wall.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-28" id="page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
From a World's End
there he turned away,
and yearned again
to find afar

his home through
shadows journeying,
and burning as
an island star</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-29" id="page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
on high above
the mists he came,
a distant flame
before the Sun,

a wonder ere
the waking dawn
where grey
the Norland
waters run.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-30" id="page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
And over Middle-Earth
he passed
and heard at last
the weeping sore

of women and
of elven-maids
in Elder Days,
in years of yore.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-31" id="page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
But on him mighty
doom was laid,
till Moon should fade,
an orbed star

to pass,
and tarry never more
on Hither Shores
where Mortals are;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-32" id="page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
or ever still
a herald on
an errand that
should never rest

to bear his
shining lamp afar,
to Flammifer
of Westernesse.</div></div>
