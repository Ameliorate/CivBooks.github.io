         The

   Ethnographer

<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 20</a><div class="page-content">  I was told about the 
case in Texas, but it 
had happened in 
another state. It has
a single protagonist 
(though in every 
story there are 
thousands of pro-
tagonists, visible 
and invisible, alive and 
dead). The man's name,
I believe, was Fred</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Murdock. He was tall,
as Americans are; his
hair was neither blond
nor dark, his features
were sharp, and he
spoke very little.
There was nothing
singular about him, not
even that feigned
singularity that young
men affect. He was
naturally respectful,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">and he distrusted
neither books nor the
men and women who
write them. He was at
that age when a man
doesn't yet know who
he is, and so is ready
to throw himself into
whatever chance puts
in his way-Persian
mysticism or the
unknown origins of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Hungarian algebra or
the hazards of war,
Puritanism or orgy. At
the university, an
adviser had interested
him in Amerindian
languages. Certain
esoteric rites still
survived in certain
tribes out West; one of
his professors, an
older man, suggested</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content">that he go live on
a reservation, ob-
serve the rites, and
discover the secret
revealed by the
medicine men to the
initiates. When he came
back, he would have
his dissertation, and
the university
authorities would see
that it was published.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">  Murdock leaped at
the suggestion. One of
his ancestors had died
in the frontier wars;
that bygone conflict
of his race was now a
link. He must have
foreseen the
difficulties that lay
ahead for him; he
would have to con-
vince the red men</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">to accept him as one
of their own. He
set upon the long
adventure. He lived
for more than two
years on the prairie,
sometimes sheltered
by adobe walls and
sometimes in the open.
He rose before dawn,
went to bed at
sundown, and came to</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">dream in a language
that was not that of
his fathers. He
conditioned his palate
to harsh flavors, he
covered himself with
strange clothing, he
forgot his friends and
the city, he came to
think in a fashion that
the logic of his mind
rejected. During the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">first few months of his
new education he
secretly took notes;
later, he tore the
notes up-perhaps
to avoid drawing
suspicion upon himself,
perhaps because he
no longer needed
them. After a period
of time (determined
upon in advance by</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">certain practices,
both spiritual and
physical), the priest
instructed Murdock
to start remembering
his dreams, and to
recount them to him
at daybreak each
morning. The young
man found that on
nights of the full
moon he dreamed of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">buffalo. He reported
these recurrent
dreams to his
teacher; the teacher
at last revealed to
him the tribe's secret
doctrine. One morning,
without saying a word
to anyone, Murdock
left.
  In the city, he was
homesick for those</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">first evenings on the
prairie when, long ago,
he had been homesick
for the city. He made
his way to his
professor's office
and told him that he
knew the secret, but
had resolved not to
reveal it.
  "Are you bound by
your oath?" the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">professor asked.
  "That's not the
reason," Murdock
replied. "I learned
something out there
that I can't express."
  "The English
language may not be
able to communicate it,"
the professor
suggested.
  "That's not it, sir.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Now that I possess the
secret, I could tell it
in a hundred dif-
ferent and even
contradictory ways. I
don't know how to tell
you this, but the
secret is beautiful,
and science, our
science, seems mere
frivolity to me now."
  After a pause, he</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">added:
  "And anyway, the
secret is not as
important as the paths
that led me to it. Each
person has to walk
those paths himself."
  The professor spoke
coldly:
  "I will inform the
committee of your
decision. Are you</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content">planning to live among
the Indians?"
  "No," Murdock
answered. "I may not
even go back to the
prairie. What the men
of the prairie taught
me is good anywhere
and for any
circumstances."
  That was the end of 
their conversation.</div></div>
