             an excerpt</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I. The Book
The place was dark and dusty and half lost
In tangles of old alleys near the quays,
Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas,
And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed.
Small lozenge panes,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">obscured by smoke and frost,
Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees,
Rotting from floor to roof--congeries
Of crumbling elder lore at little cost.

I entered, charmed, and from a cobwebbed heap
Took up the nearest</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">tome and thumbed it through,
Trembling at curious words that seemed to keep
Some secret, monstrous if one only knew.
Then, looking for some seller old in craft,
I could find nothing but a voice that laughed.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">II. Pursuit
I held the book beneath my coat, at pains
To hide the thing from sight in such a place;
Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes
With often-turning head and nervous pace.
Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brick
Peered at me oddly</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">as I hastened by,
And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sick
For a redeeming glimpse of clear blue sky.

No one had seen me take the thing--but still
A blank laugh echoed in my whirling head,
And I could guess what nighted worlds</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of ill
Lurked in that volume I had coveted.
The way grew strange--the walls alike and madding--
And far behind me, unseen feet were padding.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">III. The Key
I do not know what windings in the waste
Of those strange sea-lanes brought me home once more,
But on my porch I trembled, white with haste
To get inside and bolt the heavy door.
I had the book that told the hidden way
Across the void and</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">through the space-hung screens
That hold the undimensioned worlds at bay,
And keep lost aeons to their own demesnes.

At last the key was mine to those vague visions
Of sunset spires and twilight woods that brood</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Dim in the gulfs beyond this earth's precisions,
Lurking as memories of infinitude.
The key was mine, but as I sat there mumbling,
The attic window shook with a faint fumbling.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">IV. Recognition
The day had come again when as a child
I saw--just once--that hollow of old oaks,
Grey with a ground-mist that enfolds and chokes
The slinking shapes which madness has defiled.
It was the same--an</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">herbage rank and wild
Clings round an altar whose carved sign invokes
That Nameless One to whom a thousand smokes
Rose, aeons gone, from unclean towers up-piled.

I saw the body spread on that dark stone</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And knew those things which feasted were not men;
I knew this strange, grey world was not my own,
But Yuggoth, past the starry voids--and then
The body shrieked at me with a dead cry,
And all too late I knew that it was I!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">V. Homecoming
The daemon said that he would take me home
To the pale, shadowy land I half recalled
As a high place of stair and terrace, walled
With marble balustrades that sky-winds comb,
While miles below a maze of dome on dome</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled.
Once more, he told me, I would stand enthralled
On those old heights, and hear the far-off foam.

All this he promised, and through sunset's gate
He swept me, past the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">lapping lakes of flame,
And red-gold thrones of gods without a name
Who shriek in fear at some impending fate.
Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night:
"Here was your home," he mocked, "when you had sight!"</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">VI. The Lamp
We found the lamp inside those hollow cliffs
Whose chiseled sign no priest in Thebes could read,
And from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphs
Warned every living creature of earth's breed.
No more was there--</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">just that one brazen bowl
With traces of a curious oil within;
Fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll, And symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin.

Little the fears of forty centuries meant
To us as we bore off our slender spoil,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And when we scanned it in our darkened tent
We struck a match to test the ancient oil.
It blazed--great God! . . . But the vast shapes we saw
In that mad flash have seared our lives with awe.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">VII. Zaman's Hill
The great hill hung close over the old town,
A precipice against the main street's end;
Green, tall, and wooded, looking darkly down
Upon the steeple at the highest bend.
Two hundred years the whispers had been heard</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">About what happened on the man-shunned slope--
Tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird,
Or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope.

One day the mail-man found no village there,
Nor were its folk or houses seen again;
People came out from</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Aylesbury to stare--
Yet they all told the mail-man it was plain
That he was mad for saying he had spied
The great hill's gluttonous eyes, and jaws stretched wide.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-24" id="page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">VIII. The Port
Ten miles from Arkham I had struck the trail
That rides the cliff-edge over Boynton Beach,
And hoped that just at sunset I could reach
The crest that looks on Innsmouth in the vale.
Far out at sea was a retreating sail,
White as hard</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">years of ancient winds could bleach,
But evil with some portent beyond speech,
So that I did not wave my hand or hail.

Sails out of Innsmouth! echoing old renown
Of long-dead times. But now a too-swift night
Is closing in, and I have reached the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-26" id="page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">height
Whence I so often scan the distant town.
The spires and roofs are there--but look! The gloom
Sinks on dark lanes, as lightless as the tomb!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">IX. The Courtyard
It was the city I had known before;
The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngs
Chant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongs
In crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore.
The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at me
From where</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-28" id="page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">they keaned, drunk and half-animate,
As edging through the filth I passed the gate
To the black courtyard where the man would be.

The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursed
That ever I had come to such a den,
When suddenly a</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-29" id="page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">score of windows burst
Into wild light, and swarmed with dancing men:
Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead--
And not a corpse had either hands or head!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-30" id="page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">X. The Pigeon-Flyers
They took me slumming, where gaunt walls of brick
Bulge outward with a viscous stored-up evil,
And twisted faces, thronging foul and thick,
Wink messages to alien god and devil.
A million fires were</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-31" id="page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">blazing in the streets,
And from flat roofs a furtive few would fly
Bedraggled birds into the yawning sky
While hidden drums droned on with measured beats.

I knew those fires were brewing monstrous things,
And that those birds of space had been</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-32" id="page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Outside--
I guessed to what dark planet's crypts they plied,
And what they brought from Thog beneath their wings.
The others laughed--till struck too mute to speak
By what they glimpsed in one bird's evil beak.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-33" id="page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">XI. The Well
Farmer Seth Atwood was past eighty when
He tried to sink that deep well by his door,
With only Eb to help him bore and bore.
We laughed, and hoped he'd soon be sane again.
And yet, instead, young Eb went crazy, too.
So that they shipped</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-34" id="page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">him to the country farm.
Seth bricked the well-mouth up as tight as glue--
Then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm.

After the funeral we felt bound to get
Out to that well and rip the bricks away,
But all we saw were</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-35" id="page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">iron hand-holds set
Down a black hole deeper than we could say.
And yet we put the bricks back--for we found
The hole too deep for any line to sound.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-36" id="page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">XII. The Howler
They told me not to take the Briggs' Hill path
That used to be the highroad through to Zoar,
For Goody Watkins, hanged in seventeen-four,
Had left a certain monstrous aftermath.
Yet when I disobeyed, and had in view</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-37" id="page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The vine-hung cottage by the great rock slope,
I could not think of elms or hempen rope,
But wondered why the house still seemed so new.

Stopping a while to watch the fading day,
I heard faint howls, as from a room upstairs,
When through the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-38" id="page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">ivied panes one sunset ray
Struck in, and caught the howler unawares.
I glimpsed--and ran in frenzy from the place,
And from a four-pawed thing with human face.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-39" id="page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">XIII. Hesperia
The winter sunset, flaming beyond spires
And chimneys half-detached from this dull sphere,
Opens great gates to some forgotten year
Of elder splendours and divine desires.
Expectant wonders burn in those rich fires,
Adventure-fraught,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-40" id="page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and not untinged with fear;
A row of sphinxes where the way leads clear
Toward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres.

It is the land where beauty's meaning flowers;
Where every unplaced memory has a source;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-41" id="page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Where the great river Time begins its course
Down the vast void in starlit streams of hours.
Dreams bring us close--but ancient lore repeats
That human tread has never soiled these streets.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-42" id="page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">XIV. Star-Winds
It is a certain hour of twilight glooms,
Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind pours
Down hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors,
But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms.
The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-43" id="page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">twists,
And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,
Heeding geometries of outer space,
While Formalhaut peers in through sothward mists.

This is the hour when moonstruck poets know
What fungi sprout in</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-44" id="page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Yuggoth, and what scents
And tints of flowers fill Nithon's continents,
Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.
Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
A dozen more of ours they sweep away!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-45" id="page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">XV. Antarktos
Deep in my dream the great bird whispered queerly
Of the black cone amid the polar waste;
Pushing above the ice-sheet lone and drearly,
By storm-crazed aeons battered and defaced.
Hither no living</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-46" id="page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">earth-shapes takes their courses,
And only pale auroras and faint suns
Glow on that pitted rock, whose primal sources
Are guessed at dimply by the Elder Ones.

If men should glimpse it, they would merely wonder
What tricky mound</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-47" id="page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of Nature's build they spied;
But the bird told of vaster parts, that under
The mile-deep ice-shroud crouch and brood and bide.
God help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
Those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below!</div></div>
