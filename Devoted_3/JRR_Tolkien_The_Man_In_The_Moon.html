<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">There is an inn,
a merry old inn
beneath an old
grey hill,

And there they brew a beer so brown
That the Man in
the Moon himself
came down
one night to
drink his fill.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five-stringed fiddle;

And up and down he saws his bow
Now squeaking high, now purring low,
now sawing in the middle.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond of jokes;

When there's
good cheer
among the guests,
He cocks an ear
at all the jests
and laughs until
he chokes.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">They also keep a hornéd cow as proud as any queen;

But music turns
her head like ale,
And makes her wave her tufted tail
and dance upon the green.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">And O! the rows of silver dishes and
the store of silver spoons!

For Sunday there's
a special pair,
And these they polish up with care
on Saturday afternoons.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The Man in the Moon was drinking deep, and the cat
began to wail;

A dish and a spoon
on the table danced,
The cow in the garden madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The Man in the Moon took another mug,
and then rolled beneath his chair;

And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,
Till in the sky the stars were pale,
and dawn was
in the air.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:
'The white horses
of the Moon,

They neigh and champ their silver bits;
But their master's been and drowned
his wits,
and the Sun'll
be rising soon!'</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">So the cat on the fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,
a jig that would wake the dead:

He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:
'It's after three!'
he said.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">They rolled the Man slowly up the hill
and bundled him
into the Moon,

While his horses galloped up in rear,
And the cow came capering like a deer,
and a dish ran up
with the spoon.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum
-diddle; the dog began to roar,

The cow and the horses stood on
their heads;
The guests all bounded from
their beds
and danced
upon the floor.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">With a ping and a pang the fiddle-strings broke! the cow jumped over the Moon,

And the little dog laughed to
see such fun,
And the Saturday dish went off at a run
with the silver
Sunday spoon.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The round Moon rolled behind the hill, as the Sun raised
up her head.

She hardly believed her fiery eyes;
For though it was day, to her surprise
they all went back to bed! </div></div>
