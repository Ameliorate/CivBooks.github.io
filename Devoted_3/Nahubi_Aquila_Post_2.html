Aquila has passed two new laws, the Criminal Property Act and the Land Rights Act. The Criminal Property Act firstly deals with clarifying the definitions of certain crimes under the criminal code, </div></div>

It also clarifies certain punishments and adds a new section, Criminal Property, which defines peaceful pearling and non-peaceful pearlings. 

The other law passed, the Land Rights Act, </div></div>

Over discussions recently about the Delta Alliance Vault and diamond mining party, the Delta Alliance has received criticisms such as:

What nations are in the Delta Alliance?

L: We have a defensive pact and we store criminals in the Delta Alliance Vault. Both important for safety.</div></div>
