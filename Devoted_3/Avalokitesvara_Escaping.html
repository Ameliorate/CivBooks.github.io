Welcome, this book
won't try to tell you
girls are delicate
flowers to be always
repected, and it won't
tell you they're
biological war machines
you need to 'red pill'
yourself to deal with.
As always, remember
people are human at
the end of the day.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">What's a friendzone?

Most girls will sort men
into people they would
fuck, and people they
wouldn't. A third
category of people
they can't, but would
like to is also
available. If you do
not make the initial cut
when meeting a girl, it's
hard to</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">do.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Are you in it?


Some girls are just
shy, or have been
hurt in the past. They
may be just waiting
for you to do the
asking. If you think
this may apply to you,
ask the girl to meet up
at a night time event,
alone. If she says no,
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">you're friends.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Three Questions

1. Who usually starts
the conversations?
2. Does she prioritise
spending time with you?
3. Does she ask about
things that are
important to you, or do
you raise them?


</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">At this point, you
should be clear on if
you are in the
friendzone or not.
It is possible to
escape from, but
requires self
improvement and
discipline. If these
aren't for you, find an
easier girl you don't
have to work as hard
for. 
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">No? Good job. 

Girls like impressive
men, who mildly ignore
them but remind them
they care 'deep down'.
This involves
remembering things
that are important to
them, but ignoring them
unless you have
something interesting
to bring to the
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">conversation.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Work out what you
bring to a relationship,
and what she would
bring to you. For
every thing she has to
you, work out a
personal goal that you
can accomplish, you
don't have to share
these with anyone and
if you don't make them
the first time try
again.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Tell your girl you're
really excited to be be
doing your new
activity, then ignore
her for a while. Wait
until she says hello
first, or a week,
whichever comes first.
Let her know how well
your new activities are
going, change topic to
the new ones.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Every time you talk to
her, have something
good about you to
bring to the
conversation. Never
go into one without a
goal achieved. If you
haven't achieved it,
don't talk to her. 
A little ignoring makes
girls curious about
what you're doing that
isn't</div></div>

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">At some point, she may
start to complain that
you're spending less
time with her.
Ask her if she misses
you.
Inform her of what
your goal progress,
but say you're happy
with how things are
going so you can
afford to take a break
for a while.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Ask if she had
anything in mind,
allowing her to pick
the type of thing you
do allows you to see
the type of place she
holds you in. Remember
to be interesting, and
only talk as much to
her as she talks to
you. Watch for her
looking at you, then
away.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">If she keeps looking at
you more than she
used to, seems shy or
on edge, you have
escaped the friend
zone. Ask her if she's
alright, that she seems
bothered today.
