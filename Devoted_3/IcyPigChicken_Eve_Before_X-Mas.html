Away to the window I flew like a flash, peering out worried there was some mob to bash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, gave a luster of midday to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes was so funny, but</div></div>

He was dressed all in leather, from his head to his toes, and his clothes were all dyed red like a rose; A bundle of toys he had stashed</div></div>
