</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Once upon a time there
was a shovel. This
shovel was just like
any shovel. It had a
wooden handle, long
and majestic, sturdy
and strong while being
great for leverage. It
also had a nice flat
face, great for
scooping up all sorts
of material. 

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">one day this regular
ol' shovel decided to
say something,

 "Hello?" 
    Said the shovel.


         ......

    No one responded.

         "Hello??"
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Still no one responded.

 So the shovel tried
once again, because
as we all should know
its the third time that
is the charm.

      "Hellooo...??"

        Said the shovel. 
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Still there was no
response. What poor
luck! So the shovel sat
and waited. 

   It sat and it waited.

 It waited and waited,
until one day a person
walked in.

       "Hello!" Said the
shovel excited to see
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">someone at last.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">But the person did not
respond. They simply
rumaged through the
storage without so
much as a word in
return.

 "What a terribly rude
   person!" Thought
the shovel. "If I were
a person I would
always respond to
someone saying hello."
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Maybe another, nicer
person should come.
So the shovel waited
and waited.

 And waited.

   And waited.
    


     And waited. Until it
could wait no more...
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">

   "HELLO!!!!!!!!!?!"
    Shouted the shovel

The shovel knew that
shouting was rude. Its
annoying and
inconsiderate to those
around you. But the
shovel was sick and
tired of not being
heard. It needed some
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">attention.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">

  But the attention
never came.
   

     "Maybe I should
try a something
completely different."
    And after some
serious thinking the
shovel came up with a
brilliant idea!
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">


   "Hello?"
Green, being the most
perfect colour, was
the perfect way to
attract attention and
get people to listen. 
       "Hello!?"
The shovel repeating
itself just to make
sure it was heard.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">

   But it wasn't.
    
   It was never heard. 

    It was a shovel.

     No one listens to 
         shovels. They
          are tools.
  
 Don't listen to tools.
