  In the first cycles
of the First Age of the
First World, when the
lands were still young
and the people new,
there was a small
chasm that many called
home. For a long time,

in the people, it mani-

chasm, gaining power
and strength with each
passing day. Per-

its way and pillaging
the chasm until only a
withered husk re-

 This was the first of
the Great Disasters of

decimated, the sur-

many new places,

grow into homes for
many more to come.
