Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream,
And scenes of bliss pass as a phantom by?
The transient pleasures as a vision seem,
And yet we think the greatest pain's to die.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">How strange it is that man on earth should roam,
And lead a life of woe, but not forsake
His rugged path; nor dare he view alone
His future doom which is but to awake.</div></div>

Give me women, wine and snuff
Until I cry out <<hold, enough!>>
You may do so sans objection
Till the day of resurrection;
For bless my beard they aye shall be
My beloved Trinity.</div></div>

OH! how I love, on a fair summer's eve,
When streams of light pour down the golden west,
And on the balmy zephyrs tranquil rest
The silver clouds, far - far away to leave
All meaner thoughts, and take a sweet reprieve</div></div>

O BLUSH no so! O blush not so!
Or I shall think you knowing;
And if you smile the blushing while,
Then maidenheads are going.

There's a blush for won't, and a blush</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">for shan't,
And a blush for having done it:
There's a blush for thought and a blush for naught,
And a blush for just begun it.

O sign not so! O sigh not so!
For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">By these loosened lips you have tasted the pips
And fought in an amorous nipping.

Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,
For it only will last your youth out,
And we have the prime of the kissing time,
We have not one sweet tooth out.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">You say you love

You say you love; but with a voice
Chaster than a nun's, who singeth
The soft vespers to herself
While the chime-bell ringeth -
O love me truly!

You say you love;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">but with a smile
Cold as sunrise in September,
As you were Saint Cupid's nun,
And kept his weeks of Ember.
O love me truly!

You say you love - but the your lips
Coral tinted teach no blisses.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">More than coral in the sea -
They never pout for kisses -
O love me truly!

You say you love; but the your hand
No soft squeeze for squeeze returneth,
It is like a statue's dead -
While mine to passion burneth -</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">O love me truly!

O breathe a word or two of fire!
Smile, as if those words should burn be,
Squeeze as lovers should - O kiss
And in thy heart inurn me!
O love me truly!</div></div>

I HAD a dove and the sweet dove died;
And I have thought it died of grieving:
O, what could it grieve for? Its feet were tied,
With a silken thread of my own hand's weaving;
Sweet little red feet! why should you die -</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Why should you leave me, sweet bird! why?

Why, pretty thing! would you not live with me?
I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas;
Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?</div></div>

FOUR Seasons fill the measure of the year;
There are four seasons in the mind of man:
He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear
Takes in all beauty with an easy span:
He has his Summer,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">when luxuriously
Spring's honey'd cud of youthful thought he loves
To ruminate, and by such dreaming high
Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves
His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings
He furleth close; contented so to look
On mists in idleness -</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to let fair things
Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
He has his winter too of pale misfeature,
Or else he would forego his mortal nature.</div></div>

NO, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
Wolfs-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
Make not your rosary of yew-berries,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.

But when the melancholy fit shall</div></div>

Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
Or on the wealth of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.

She dwells with Beauty - Beauty that must die;</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-28" id="page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching pleasure nigh,
Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-29" id="page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,
And be among her cloudy trophies hung.</div></div>

SEASONS of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Cospiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-31" id="page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;

Drows'd with the</div></div>

Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,

THOU still unravish'd bride of quietness,

A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!</div></div>

Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell:
No God, no demon of severe response,
Deigns to reply from heaven or from Hell.
