By Nahubi

Around 9PM Central Time last night (2/17), Aquila officially convicted it's first criminal of crimes. </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Pugggles, who had been a resident for roughly 2 or 3 days before the incidents, was found guilty of three counts of theft and four counts of breaking and entering after pleading guilty. 

Gjum, Chief Justice of Aquila, sentenced Puggles to:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">three days of exile pearling in addition to the two days he had already served;
Banishment from Aquila and it's territories for two weeks effective immediately;
and reparations in full to all victims.

The crime was first reported several days earlier by </div></div>

Could this mean a new wave of crime in Aquila? It will remain to be seen.</div></div>

By Nahubi

On Friday night, DocWifi proposed legislature on the Aquila subreddit that would give landowners more rights under law.

(cont. next page)</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The purpose of the Land Rights Act, as stated, is the following:

The purpose of this bill is to define the rights of land owners within the city of Aquila and in the outlying territory, to designate powers of eviction and demolition, and to grant</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">powers of eminent domain to the Government of Aquila.

Of course, the Act gives the right to land owners protection from trespassing, breaking and entering, and unlawful search and seizure, as well as the right to sell their land.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">However, the Act would also give the Executive Council the ability to give land out to new residents (rather than the legislature), evict any person found guilty of a crime, and to purchase property from citizens via eminent domain for government use.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">It also makes it illegal to tax road usage, and officially gives all road blocks from infinite depth and height to the government of Aquila, along with any government building. 

While the majority of these rights are good, it also gives more power to the</div></div>

It would also reduce the time of citizenship loss after sale of property from "until the next census" to 24 hours after the sale. MrShroom97, who campaigned with the Free Bird Party, promised small government as a principle</div></div>

However, there is no legal way for the Executive Council to veto an order like this, so his only alternative would be to convince the legislature to vote against the law.
