A great conflict was about to come off between Ruin and Volterra.

When the two armies were collected together a Newfriend hesitated which side to join.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Ruin fighter that passed him farming said:

"Come with us"; but the newfriend said: "I am Volterran."

Later on, some Volterrans who were passing underneath his treehouse looked up and said:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Come with us"; but the newfriend said: "I am from Ruin."

Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle took place, so the newfriend came to Ruin and wished to join in the rejoicings-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">but they all turned against him and he had to ride a horse away.

He then went to Volterra, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else they would have vaulted him no doubt. 

"Ah," said the newfriend, "I see now-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"He that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends."

...</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Two Friends and the Big Dog

PridevGreed and Eznys were the best of friends and travelling together through a Jungle, when a Big Dog’s member rushed out upon them.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Pride happened to be in the back and pearled up onto the treetops quickly as to hide himself among the leaves.

Eznys, seeing no help for it, threw his inventory down upon the ground, to at least avoid being pearled as well.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Big Dog, coming up to him, put his sword at his neck then, and sniffed and sniffed, trying to see if there was any other valuables.

But at last with a sniff he shook his head and slouched off, </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">for this Big Dog wanted to not have bad PR. Before he left he whispered something to Eznys.

Then Pride up in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said :

"What was it that PvP Monster whispered to you?"</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"He told me," said Eznys: "Never trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch"</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Dollaz and the Snake

Dollaz and Jumpysnake were disputing who was stronger.

Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and then Jumpysnake said:

"I see a way to decide our dispute."</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off his armor and give it to us shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin."

So Jumpy retired behind a tree to watch, and Dollaz with a coolpvp smirk began to pot up and click upon the traveler.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">As he clicked he was shouting “Give me your prot or die!”

But the Faster he clicked more the traveler ran and needed to keep his armor for protection, till at last Dollaz had ran out of speed and gave up in despair.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">So then Jumpysnake came out looking concerned for the traveler and kindly said, “Was that meanyface attacking you? I can beat him but have no armor, can I borrow yours?”

The traveler overwhelmed with the kindness-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">of his words and deeds, quickly removed his armor and tossed it to jumpy.

“Ah.” Said Dollaz, “Might doesn’t always make right.”</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Wise Raider and the Channer

A Chanadian and a Raider who has never been caught went to pillage a small town of newfriends together.

After a successful raid the Channer was boasting to the Raider-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">of his clever devices for escaping his enemies.

"I have a whole bag of tricks goyim," he said, "which contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies."

"I have only one," said the Wise Raider; "but I can generally manage with that."</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Just at that moment they heard the WEEWOOWEEWOO cry of a pack of pvp hungry WP officers coming towards them, and the Wise Raider immediately pearled into a lake dropped his boat and sailed away.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"This is my plan," pm’d the Riader. "What are you going to do?"

The Channer thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating the WP came nearer and nearer-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">and at last the Channer in his confusion was caught up by the WP and soon pearled by the screeching pvpr’s.

The wise raider, who had been looking on, said: "Better one safe plan way than a hundred on which have never been tried."</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-24" id="page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Pearling of a Tier 1 Fighter

A Tier 1 fighter preparing for battle to help his “friends,” placed a double chest of pots down for his own use during the conflict. But their bunker came under surprise attack and-</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">couldn’t be bothered to reinforce his chest. 

He stated, “I will help win this fight, but I need these pots to do so.”

His companions came in great numbers just to fight alongside the PvP legend and hopefully be noticed.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-26" id="page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">As the battle raged and supplies ran low, each one who fought with him helped himself to a share of the pots which had been placed for his use.

Eventually they got overwhelmed to the point where the Tier 1 fighter was pearled. </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">He was vaulted not from his own incompetence, but from the failure of surrounding himself with true allies.</div></div>
