<div class="book">
<div class="page"><a href="#page-1" id="page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 4</a><div class="page-content">At first there was nothing.

Only a cosmic storm of duping and jajapvpers on a now dead server.

And then an idea popped into Bonkill's head.

What if I made my own server, with sharding, and hookers.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 4</a><div class="page-content">And so it was done.

It was called /r/Devoted, mainly because Bonkill had squated on that subreddit.

But also because he wanted to make a happy place for autistic children to spend their lives on instead of going outside.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 4</a><div class="page-content">He asked his civ-dad ProgrammerDan to help him.

And so there was spigot.

And from that came Devoted 1.0 which everyone agrees was a silly experiment.

Then Devoted 2.0 launched.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 4</a><div class="page-content">It was much better and had less sharding.

But it was just Devoted bro.

And then, this world was born... and it was good.</div></div>
