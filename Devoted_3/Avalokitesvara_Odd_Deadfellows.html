<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Am I going crazy...
or are you seeing this
too?" Ossein mused
to me from behind his
hiding spot, a pair of
close spruce trees.

"Well... you're crazy
for sure, but yeah,
I see it too,"
I responded, keeping
my</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">voice low.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">From our concealed
location among the
treeline, we could
see a guy running
through the night,
punching a pig with his
bare hands. The pig
seemed to be trying to
make it to the beach,

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I guess he assumed
his attacker couldn't
swim. It was a decent
escape plan, aside
from that big 'if' it
hinged on. Plus, the
guy's strides were
much wider than
the pig's panicked
scampers, cutting off
any real hope</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">of any
escape.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The little guy was still
50 or so feet from the
waters edge when his
hunter finally knocked
him down and prepared
the killing blow, raising
his fist and licking his
lips.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I was just about to
motion to Ossein to
move in when a wolf
came bolting out of the
trees to the west of
us so fast that,
I swear, it looked
like it was flying.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Its paws seemed to
push off of the air
above the grass,
cutting through the
weeds like a rocket.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The wolf leaped
between the pig and
the hunter, catching
the hammerblow meant
for the pig square on
its front shoulder,
momentarily knocking it
to the dirt.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">It was only down for a
split second, before
turning and springing
at the man once again
like an animal
possessed.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Silently, I motioned
for Ossein to stay in
position. I wanted to
see how this played
out. He nodded and
turned back to watch
the action himself,
lowering his bow to his
side.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The man was now
ignoring the pig,
focusing his attacks
on his canine
assailant. The wolf
was lightning quick,
relentlessly charging,
snapping, growling,
keeping the hunter
somewhat off balance.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Out of thin air,
the man in the
bluish-green shirt
materialized a sword
made of rough-hewn
stone. With a rapid
flurry of strikes, he
fended the wolf off,
forcing it back a good
distance, starting a
kind of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 32</a><div class="page-content">standoff.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The man swinging the
sword around in an
attempt to ward off
the animal, and the
wolf circling him and
growling fiercely,
apparently trying to
keep the man's
attention off of the
pig who was now
slowly crawling</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">away,
gravely wounded.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Is that wolf...
protecting the pig?"
Ossein whispered.

"That's crazy...
but yeah. That's
what it looks like,
don't it?" I
responded, in awe
myself.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Ossein paused
and seemed to
contemplate something
before continuing,
"I got 3 gold ingots
that says the wolf
takes him down."

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I wasn't really a
gambler, but for some
reason, I felt inspired
by the ferocious
battle unfolding
before us. "Sure.
I'll take that action,"
I replied, turning
my attention back
to the fight.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The pig had managed
to crawl nearly to the
tree line when the wolf
began round two. With
incredible agility it
leaped, jaws bared,
for the swordsman's
throat.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The blue-clad warrior
dodged, swinging to the
side as the wolf missed
its terminal mark by
only inches. The
swordsman saw his
opportunity and took
it.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-24" id="page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">As the wolf landed,
back now facing the
man, his sword flashed
in the night air like the
glow of an enderman,
burying itself into the
wolf's spine.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">With a whine, the wolf
fell motionless. The
man was alone now,
the wolf defeated,
and the pig it
defended disappeared
into the trees.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-26" id="page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Son-of-a-... ,"
Ossein griped about
the bet, though his
enamored amazement
at the battle itself was
more than obvious.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Don't worry about
it. Keep your gold.
That fight was
entertainment
enough," I said,
"Now, let's hit him
while he's tired
and distracted."

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-28" id="page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Right you are," he
replied as he leveled
his bow and began
advancing through the
woods edge towards
the swordsman.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-29" id="page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I crept beside him,
getting as close as I
could to the man. He
hadn't seen us yet,
and that was good.
Surprise was key.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-30" id="page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 32</a><div class="page-content">We were probably
about 10 feet or so
behind him before he
gave any indication
that he heard my
hissing. By the time he
turned around though,
it was too late. The
arrow Ossein slammed
into his shoulder
stunned him</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-31" id="page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 32</a><div class="page-content">long
enough for me to go
off.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-32" id="page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Boom, baby.
