Such a fascinating and empowering position in any society no? In fact, Very empowering! Well, you are reading this manual of sorts in order to become the Politician, yes with a capital P. I am by no means an expert </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">but I am certainly experienced enough to be an authority on such topics. Here we shall review the ins and outs of becoming the Politician.

1. Know your audience
Like any capitalist market or those fancy data algorithms I hear so much about, you must know</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">the demands and aspirations of the average worker. Sometimes you will be surprised by the intersection of interests among groups. They can be aimless uneducated morons (I love the uneducated personally) or Politicians in the making. From this wide</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">net, you will find yourself a capable group of individuals who can coordinate and organize these groups.

<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">organizing other efforts….something to be discussed later. Make sure they are capable but not too capable or ambitious for that matter! Just the right mix of rigid loyalty and ingenuity. With your small group of loyalist, you will spread you influence to</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">the many individuals and organizations of all ideological persuasions.

3. Breaking institutions

Let us be honest, democracy is a façade. The Politician knows this all too well! Populism is your friend, a powerful tool that when wield </div></div>

You must exclaim almost immediately that something is broken. What’s broken? Well, that’s for you to figure out. Maybe it is true or maybe it isn’t. Regardless you must destroy these </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">these flawed institutions and replace them with something better and one that empowers the Politician and his inter-circle. 

4. Fear triumphs
