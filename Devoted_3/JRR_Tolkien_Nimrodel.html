An Elven-maid
there was of old,
A shining star by day.

Her mantle white
was hemmed with gold,
Her shoes of silver-grey.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
A star was bound
upon her brows,
A light was on her hair

As sun upon
the golden boughs
In Lorien the fair.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
Her hair was long,
her limbs were white,
And fair she was
and free;

And in the wind
she went as light
As leaf of linden-tree.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
Beside the falls
of Nimrodel,
By water
clear and cool,

Her voice as
falling silver fell
Into the shining pool.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
Where now
she wanders
none can tell,
In sunlight
or in shade;

For lost of yore
was Nimrodel
And in the mountains
strayed.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
The elven-ships
in haven grey
Beneath the
mountain-lee

Awaited her
for many a day
Beside the
roaring sea.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
A wind by night
in Northern lands
Arose, and
loud it cried,

And drove the ship
from elven-strands
Across the
steaming tide.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
When dawn came dim
the land was lost,
The mountains
sinking grey

Beyond the heaving waves that tossed
Their plumes of blinding spray.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
Amroth beheld
the fading shore
Now low beyond
the swell,

And cursed
the faithless
ship that bore
Him far from Nimrodel.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
Of old he was
an Elven-king,
A lord of tree
and glen,

When golden were
the boughs in spring
In fair Lothlorien.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
From helm to sea
they saw him leap,
As arrow from
the string,

And dive into
the water deep,
As mew upon
the wing.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
The wind was in
his flowing hair,
The foam about
him shone;

Afar they saw him
strong and fair
Go riding like a swan.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">
But from the West
has come no word,
And on the
Hither Shore

No tidings Elven-folk have heard
Of Amroth evermore.</div></div>
