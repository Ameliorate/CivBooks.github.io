Well lucky for you, you came to the right place. With this knowledge, you will be able to tell people to fuck off, fuck all the bitches, and just overall have fuck</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 40</a><div class="page-content">you money. Or you could be a productive citizen of a nation of your choice. Just make sure to pick an established nation like Mount Augusta or Vogelburg. Don't pick a dead nation like Hayek or Mount Athos. Your friendships and resources will be vital.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 40</a><div class="page-content">So lets get started.

The basics.

So right now, you should have nothing. And that is perfectly fine. But it isn't fine when you're trying to barter with people or you are about a month in on this server. What are you,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 40</a><div class="page-content">a lazy bum? Of course not. So in this chapter, we are going to talk about what baby steps you will need to do in order to get the monies and put an end to you abusing my tax dollars on your welfare.
At the end of this book will be the index. Look at it.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Route Uno; Mining

That's right. You can take the early 50s approch and become a hard worker in the mine shafts underground, 100 blocks below sea level. Little risk, little reward. Sometimes the payout is huge, maybe diamonds or titanium, but don't</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 40</a><div class="page-content">bet on it. Your main source of income from mining will be tier ores. Make sure to save anything that have a T1, T2, OR T3. Granted, noboy uses T3, it will be important in the future, when everyone is upgrading their factories.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Don't worry about what the fuck a factory is, because all you are is a leech freeloading off of my potatoes and bread.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Route Dos: Farming

That's right you lazy fuck. Farming. This shit is low risk, mid reward, where you could set up a whole field for potatoes. People tend to not want to do this easy task, especially national officals, so make sure to cash in on their</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 40</a><div class="page-content">desprate needs to feed their people. What you'll need to do is ask someone for some potatoes. Uncooked. And then you'll need to set up a base to farm them. I suggjest out in the boonies since nobody will bother you. But beware, a lone player might come &</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 40</a><div class="page-content">fuck yo shit, so be cautios about this. A Double Chest of stacks of potaoes can be worth about 20 D +-. So that will be a great start, but it will be grindy.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Route Trees: Raiding

In raiding, you should be aware that there is a security system players use to see who fucked with their shit. So I would not reccomend it unless you are the World Police or you are in a raider gang that can hold their</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 40</a><div class="page-content">own. When raiding, you face the consoquences of not being able to spell, getting yourself killed, getting raided yourself, or even pearled. When you get pearled, you will not be able to raid anymore, and you won't be able to go anywhere that has a bastion</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 40</a><div class="page-content">or within 1,000 blocks of your pearl. This method of getting the monies is High Risk low reward unless you know what the fuck you are doing. And it takes skill to raid on here. I suggjest you don't raid if you want to make friends or you want to not be </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 40</a><div class="page-content">looking over your shoulder everytime you leave the bunker you have made. Because, lets be honest here, you will have a bunker. It doesn't get the attention of raiders, and it is easy to hide out in.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Route Four: XP

That's right. Let your inner neckbeard show with this medium risk, medium reward method. With things like XP spawners being a thing, you'll be able to afk all night and sell the four stacks you made for about 8 Diamonds.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">An XP spawner looks like a regular mob spawner except it only spawns 4 XP every now and then. It takes about 1.5 hours to get a stack of xp and if you do it over the weekend, you will get rich in no time. These XP spawners cost about 20+ diamonds so be </div></div>

You can squat there alllll niiiight loooong baby. But remember, since you'll be afk (unless you don't have a life) you will be vulnerable to an attack. And remember, you will need to bottle</div></div>

The easiest way to get 3 stacks of glass is to make a smelting factory. Here is a guide on factories [https://www.reddit.com/r/Devoted/wiki/info_d3#wiki_factorymod]
When you do this, you will need a stack</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 40</a><div class="page-content">of sand and some coal. If you need to make some XP to get the factory, use a public enchantement table and go get some fucking sand. It isn't hard. Facory shit is a little ahead but very helpful. I would say get about 10 bottles of XP to get started.</div></div>
