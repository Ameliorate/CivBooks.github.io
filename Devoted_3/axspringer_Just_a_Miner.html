  "How do I reinforce?" Sammy was at a lost for the mechanics of the plugins. I dcouldnt blame her, Citadel is rather uncommon mod, and she only just stared playing minecraft besides. "You have to type /ctr."</div></div>

"You dont have access, one sec..."
She could only handle about half an hour of struggling to dig, with me as a reminder to her slowness. It didnt help that I was pulling up ores faster than she could open doors. So she logged out. At this</div></div>

We felt too threatened by the consistent raids by B0W and other griefers while we were living in Alpoko. I liked the folks over there, but Havana's lax leadership and absence made the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">nation rather undeveloped. 
   So we moved to Mt. Augusta. Sir_Grettir was kind enough to escort us, accompanied by Mirakels. They gave us a space of undeveloped land in the countryside, and we set to work right away. We soon had a small wheat and carrot </div></div>

After a week or so, I familiarized myself with my neighbors. Joined the discord. I found a fellow farmer across the border that had cows, sheep, and pigs. I was able to buy a couple pigs off em,</div></div>

   Now, the thing about playing Devoted- playing multiplayer-

   Sammy and I were out harvesting crops. My Radar</div></div>

   Now, when youre a pvp'r, your reflexes and sense are tuned to acute detections and focus on small, fast messages spamming from all sides. You are ready to react on a moments notice. 
     However</div></div>

And Sammy certainly isnt.
   So by the time I actually noticed the mounted rider in full diamond gear, Sammy was already burnt to crisp, her seeds and wheat scattered round the ground where she stood. OmSaiRam greeted us with 2 words:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">"whatup homie"
  I was already running.
  My only chance was to dip into the mine, and get to the bunker we just made... but it isnt reinforced yet! theres no gurantee of safety....

Luckily, the knockback from his attack propelled me toward the waterdrop we have to our mine. I scrambled to break the secret entrance, replace the blocks, and sprint to the bunker. I turned off the lights, squeezed the</div></div>

    Someone must have heard my prayers, because he was still triggering the snitches up at the treehouse.

I'm not a pvp'r, I'm not a political power player, Im not an expert or griefer or artist or architect, I dont do anything beyond the average. And now I was being punished for my weakness. No, Sammy was. I just couldnt. I'm just.....</div></div>
