<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">The leaves were long,
the grass was green,

The hemlock-umbels
tall and fair,

And in the glade
a light was seen

Of stars in shadow shimmering.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Tinuviel was
dancing there

To music of
a pipe unseen,

And light of stars
was in her hair,

And in her raiment glimmering.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">There Beren came
from mountains cold.

And lost he wandered under leaves,

And where the Elven-river rolled

He walked alone and sorrowing.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He peered between the hemlock-leaves

And saw in wonder flowers of gold

Upon her mantle
and her sleeves

And her hair like shadow following.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Enchantment healed his weary feet

That over hills
were doomed to roam;

And forth
he hastened,
strong and fleet,

And grasped at moonbeams glistening.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Through woven woods in Elvenhome

She lightly fled on dancing feet,

And left him lonely still to roam

In the silent forest listening.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He heard there oft the flying sound

Of feet as light
as linden-leaves,

Or music welling underground,

In hidden hollows quavering.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,

And one by one
with sighing sound

Whispering fell
the beachen leaves

In wintry woodland wavering.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He sought her ever, wandering far

Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,

By light of moon
and ray of star

In frosty heavens shivering.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Her mantle glinted
in the moon,

As on a hill-top
high and far

She danced,
and at her feet was strewn

A mist of silver quivering.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">When winter passed, she came again,

And her song released the
sudden spring,

Like rising lark,
and falling rain,

And melting water bubbling.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He saw the elven-flowers spring

About her feet,
and healed again

He longed by her
to dance and sing

Upon the grass untroubling.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Again she fled,
but swift he came,

Tinuviel! Tinuviel!

He called her
by her elvish name;

And there she halted listening.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">One moment stood she, and a spell

His voice laid on her: Beren came,

And doom fell
on Tinuviel

That in his arms
lay glistening.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">As Beren looked
into her eyes

Within the shadows
of her hair,

The trembling starlight of the skies

He saw there mirrored shimmering.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Tinuviel the elven-fair,

Immortal maiden elven-wise,

About him cast
her shadowy hair

And arms like
silver glimmering.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Long was the way
that fate them bore,

O'er stony mountains cold and grey,

Through halls of iron and darkling door,

And woods
of nightshade morrowless.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 19</a><div class="page-content">The Sundering Seas between them lay,

And yet at last
they met once more,

And long ago
they passed away

In the forest
singing sorrowless.</div></div>
