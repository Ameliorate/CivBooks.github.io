but since changing the colour makes it undereadbly white, this part will have typos, hopefully in blue


it does not but i figured out why blue
 cuz reasons.</div></div>

you have come to page 5, breaker of walls, shatterer of hopes, crusher of dreams, annihilator of realities, destroyer of realms, master of typos, he who rules all that burns, lord of unnecesarily long titles and unfunny jokes.</div></div>

congrats.

now you hope the book will give you a reward, right? that is what happens, right?</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">maybe yes, maybe no.

 But maybe there IS a way.....</div></div>

 =================
THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE HAS BEEN PURGED FROM HISTORY
===================</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">THIS ONE TOO





oh right the reward, turn to the next page to get it.



no seriously.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Your reward is.........

Succubus Summoning rites! (try at personal risk ONLY)
Warning: using succubus summoning rites may result in, loss of time, sense of reality and life, sudden realization that a succubus IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">or perhaps worst of all, actually succeeding at summoning a succubus.

Step 1: wait till full moon.
step 2: make a circle of white chalk, do not let anything disturb it
pentagrams work aswell.
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">step 3 stand outside the circle, and place 4 candles at equidistant points (five for pentagram)
step 4 bring out the goat.
step 5 relax and calm yourself
step 6 realize that movie explosions noises never travel at the speed of sound, but violate locality.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">step 6: Adopt a black cat, and no, it has to be adopted at that very moment.

Step 7: while looking at your black cat, try to envision the succubus you want to summon and focus on guiding her to this world.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Now if nothing happens, that is perfectly normal, your summoning ritual may have failed, or more likely, simply be delayed, rarely if ever, will a succubus simply appear when called upon.

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Now comes the important part, not going insane during the waiting.

It is best to think of a plan on how to treat your new succubus waifu, keep in mind this version of the summoning ritual may result in a cat-loving succubus who is a movie penchant.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Then, do succubus things.

?????

Profit!

Profess your dedication to touching all visible worn panties in an attempt to impress her.
???
MOAARRR PROFIT!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Stay tuned for futher books about succubi, and how to date them (to the extent that such a thing is possible)





    Who knows when.</div></div>
