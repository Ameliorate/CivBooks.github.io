Author's Note: This is the first and only record of the Thieves' Guild and may be the last. Please treat this book with respect and know that all information within is yours alone. All names have been changed.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">As most great things, the Thieves' Guild had humble beginnings. It began merely as the dream of two brothers in arms, looking for a new life. A life of adventure and success, taking wealth from the rich and privelaged and lowering them to the level of the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">common man.
The first step to the foundation was to get the necessary capital to begin, leading to the first heist. 
We robbed as much as we could and left fat and happy, but without a place to store our goods. We used a local tavern as our temporary base</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">of operations. We built some chests and buried them to keep them safe and secure from prying eyes until we got a more permanent residence.
For our base, we had to find somewhere hidden, but still nearby. We finally settled on hiding it beneath a deep lake</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">at the bedrock.
It's a decent place, two bedrooms, an entry hall, and a modest melon farm. We have one room dedicated to exceptional loot with a cart going around it.
Once the base was set up, we went out for another round of robbery.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">On this heist, we again went to Aristopolis. We targeted every large house and stole everything that wasn't bolted to the floor. We went into a large tower via a dirt tower we built and began rummaging around. I remained up top and stole what was there </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">whilst CockBane rummaged around below. One local law enforcement agent spotted him, inquiring as to who the proper owner of the house was. I jumped and landed in the water and quickly began speeding away while CockBane attempted to follow.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">We managed to escape unpearled, but we had been branded as thieves.
We tried to wait in the guild until it all blew over, but it seemed as though they weren't going to stop looking. We finaly decided it would be best just to turn ourselves in and take the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">pearling after CockBane was pearled while attempting further theft. The End is dull, painfully so. There are many people, but nothing else but endstone and endermen. There was no wood or anything else from which to build anything.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">When finally we were unpearled, we just went back to our life of crime, but were more cautious this time.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">There's a war now, between the HCF and the CivCrafters. It's taken the entire world by surprise, griefers run rampant and there's not enough police to stop them all. This seems like a perfect time to loot where they've been, cleaning up after them, but</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">they would take all the blame. We now loot as opportunity allows and have accumulated a small fortune consisting of a few stacks of rail, numerous stacks of stone and netherrack as well as netherbrick, countless stacks of melon, numerous diamond weapons</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">and tools, all of powerful enchantment, three enchanted bows, three stacks of redstone, two stacks of iron, and 19 diamonds, all of which are hidden within our base behind locked chests. Our fortune is modest, but will only grow as we buy nothing and </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">continually increase our stock through theft. We may eventuall set up shops to sell unneeded materials, mostly stolen, to give our members a more public and respectable face. We may even become involved in politics eventually and control a small hamlet. </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">We don't, however, plan to expand our membership as it is not certain that the recruits would be trustworthy enough to know our location and have access to our loot. </div></div>

We are currently working on turning LittleBrother into an asset, buying him land in various high-value</div></div>

</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">We have gained our first asset today, LittleBrother. His morals did crumble slightly and he is our inside man. He currently only has housing in Aristopolis but we are looking into land in other cities as well, though Aristopolis seems to be the best due </div></div>

Leningrad is long abandoned, but still full of resources. It's a great place to loot since even cares about it.</div></div>
