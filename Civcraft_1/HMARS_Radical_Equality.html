Anything that comes out of a movie should probably taken at least with a grain of salt, but Fight Club certainly has a point. Disregarding, of course, the utter insanity of the focal character and his bizarrely primitivist beliefs,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">he has a point.You are not special, and, in general, people are not special. Humans are very often wonderful, very often beautiful. But not special. You were born just like everyone else was, and you'll die sometime in the not-so-distant future, too.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">And yet we find ourselves playing a game (call it "life") on a field which is not particularly level. We learn, generally from an early age, that fairness is good, and that we should share our toys with others. And yet somehow, despite all this,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">life is not fair. This is, we learn, Simply How Things Are; the sky is blue, the grass is green, and life is unfair. But what if it doesn’t have to be unfair? What if it wasn’t? </div></div>

<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 8</a><div class="page-content">This world has no landlords, no white supremacists, no homophobes, because it is fundamentally, pivotally based upon a radical, powerful, indeed revolutionary  equality! If nobody is special, nobody gets left out! This is the heart of socialism! </div></div>
