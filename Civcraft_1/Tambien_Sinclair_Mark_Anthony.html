from Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare (1564 – 1616)
~~~~~
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 8</a><div class="page-content">have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 8</a><div class="page-content">once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.</div></div>
