Time brings entropy, and with it: destruction.

As mountains erode,
as lakes lose their sourcewaters,
as all things become no more, so is the fate of all people.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Take comfort in this. Every soul to ever live has known its own death. It is the most common thing in the universe. We are lucky to die, for it means that we are alive.

In defiance of all infinite possibility, you read this.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Take pride in the time you have. It is already more than can be expected of the universe.

You are here.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 7</a><div class="page-content">II. Power and You

If you place salt in water, it will surely dissolve. Are all things fated to one end? Are we naught but chemical robots?

Cogito ergo sum. You can be sure that you exist. However, you</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 7</a><div class="page-content">aren't separate from nature and its laws. 

You are an integral bit in nature and fate. As fate and nature decide all, you as a part of them decide part of that "all."

You aren't omnipotent, but you are potent.</div></div>
