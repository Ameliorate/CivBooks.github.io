Good afternoon gents and girls.
Are you comfy, plenty of nibbles about?
Good.
For here is the tale of Peter Pan, a disgruntled poet
with his face slammed against the wall of writers block.
His muse drowned in a swig of Cuban</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 34</a><div class="page-content">rum.
The slim possibility of the next poem at the bottom of each bottle,
while 50s Uncle Sam screams red to McCarthy tunes.
The Neon sign of Never Never land hotel burns dead,
A kingdom of lost youth.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Forever prowled by lost boys,
Forever the hunting grounds of the biker king of Hook
Who thrusts his lust into the harlot Wendy.
All while blood flows to the feisty groans
Of the sociopath Crocodile.
All these players</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">don’t know it;
All these gamblers of wild beats have their cards on the table.
And someone is bluffing for soon the jig is up.
Another day dawns on the Neon.
Another swig for Peter dearest
Another bloody body for the croc,</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Another hateful kiss for Wendy from the Hook.
Peter walks to the window,
Another failed poem brought from futile inspiration.
He can fly he can fly.
Tinkerbelle’s opiates burn his lobes.
The window ledge is now the kingdom of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">the drunk,
dry stanzas flow like ash from his lips.
He can fly he can fly.
He is ready for the greatest trip.
Alas good fortune emerges. He steps away from the throne,
tears taste the lips. Hope bubbles from his stomach.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
His anguish breaths in and out
the beaten lungs the reality of his horror mumbles to his heart.
But the muse oozes back;
the drunken haze combines
with the opiate mist and falls back.
Inspiration has come.
He rips the pen</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">from his breast pocket and
rapes his notebook for words.
The anguish, the hate and the abyss
spill out from the pen into the brutal shape of a poem,
a poem of wonderful panicked desperation.
Stanzas of bottle</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lust cantos of hate
and flowing iambs of street crime beating with
the sound of soulless sex yet the
dirge of weird rang out to the cyclone of a morel of hope.
It is finished,
his poem.
The hazy thought that saved him</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">from the abyss
and returned him to the world.
Proud of his opus
this poem
this hurricane of rotted emotion and hope, he reads it aloud.
Peter Pan Breath’s life onto the page
and lets the words spill from his</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lungs to the world.
The sounds of pain laced hope slithers down the broken walls,
a broken lass sheds the tears as the word reaches her ears.
Like a drug she is intoxicated,
a moth to the flame she flows to the poem.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Then to Peter.
To his warmth.
To Wendy, Peter flows, anguish oozes out of
him as they share their warmth.
Their moans of heat, their bodies’ groan for the others flesh.
Lust turned too love, a cyclone was tamed.
The pain was</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">gone.
Replaced by the joy of another soul.
It could never last,
It could never be,
It would be an abomination.
A cry of damnation to the world.
But Peter and Wendy did not care, they only cared
For the Garden of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Eden they represented to each other.
Love that can topple
Anguished that is drowned
How can it last?
Wendy and Peter did not know, nor did they care.
Their only care was survival. Survival of the joy they had</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Survival of the spark that burned now into an inferno.
Then the passion had cooled
But the flame still there.
The two youths parted, but felt life pump in their veins.
From the abyss came Peter and from the terror of Hook</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">came Wendy
But the cards still lay, the game was still going.
New pieces were to be thrown into the grinder.
While the two lovers returned to the swill, the dark biker
Was ready to carry out his will. A beast he was with macabre</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Joys playing on crooked heart strings.
Crooked strings that danced to a hatful desire
Crooked Strings that rang to a sinful pleasure
Crooked strings that beat to a monsters game
Crooked strings</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">tied into a noose for Wendy’s soul.
When those eyes of his pierced the gaze to her,
his dark soul churned for another feast to her soul
a soul beaten down to the foundation of his wicked kingdom.
But Wendy had the glow</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
The flow of life.
When the hook met the harlot, her fury rang out to a powerful roar
A roar of defiance
A roar of release from years of treacherous hedonism.
A roar that transmuted into blows after blow of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-20" id="page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">vengeance.
The biker king de throne, the hook lay in portrait of his blood.
Wendy was alive
The rush of hate left her arms
She felt a vibe in the world.
A vibe of peace
The lost boys saw it too, the vibe was</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-21" id="page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">now birthed into the world
Slipping forth from a womb of agony, the vibe was a scream
A scream of defiance to the woes of selfish blood spilt.
Selfish blood the croc drank all to eagerly.
Selfish blood that drove Hook to a desire for gore</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-22" id="page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Selfish blood that took Hook to the croc.
Selfish blood that forced the croc under command to indulge
To indulge in stealing life in the most horrid of dances.
To indulge in dances of doom.
So the Croc</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-23" id="page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">slithered
So the Croc hunted, the aroma of flesh in his nostrils.
The aroma flowing from the lifted heart of our dear little harlot.
The jaws of the crocs snapped
Snapped her soul into shreads.
Snapped her body</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-24" id="page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">into bloody abstraction
Snapped her life into the black oblivion
And even though the vibe stayed at never never land
The vibe that lifted so many hearts and ensured a better day
The vibe could not stand against a tide of horrors</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-25" id="page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
Horrors that Peter saw from his window
He saw the fair flesh of Wendy bled grey,
He saw the fair soul trampled to dust,
He saw the jaws of doom snap shut.
He saw the Hook watching in glee.
The love turned to hate, the calm turned to anger.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-26" id="page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
The vibe became a roar!
Peter roared from the throne too the dirt below!
He roared to Hook, he roared to Croc.
And he roared to all the lost youth of the land.
He roared for them to carry out vengeance.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-27" id="page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
And the lost boys heard with their souls.
The croc was beaten dead by many hands,
Many hands carrying blood oaths
Many hands declaring joy to the doom of croc
Many hands forced the Hook upwards to a burning hate.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-28" id="page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
With a fire axe in hand Peter charged through steps,
He charged down the steps to Hook like a deranged Valkyrie
With its eyes set on gore.
And Hook Charged upwards eyes burning with an awesome
Tyranny.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-29" id="page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">
The lost youth cornered the biker king of no throne,
And the king cornered the vengeful prince
They met in between lands of Never Never land
And collided with the force of a monstrous critical mass
The axe fell from over Peters head</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-30" id="page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">as if slamming shut
A valve that let evil into the world,
The hooked knife of the king thrusted forward.
In a deadly game their hate locked, the a blade and axe
Slashed at one and the other, the blades were locked
Simple additions to</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-31" id="page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lifetimes of wondrous agony.
Blood to blood
Steel to steel
The dance played on
Until to the end with one last ugly slash,
Of the axe a river of warm red life surged from the
Wicked neck of Hook.
And the hooked knife slide out from the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-32" id="page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 34</a><div class="page-content">torn poet.
Slide out letting loose the flow of Peters soul.
Game
Set
Match for the foes
And the lost boys watched, they watched they anger, this dance of war.
And they sobbed, but felt a great</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-33" id="page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 34</a><div class="page-content">burden lifted from Atlas shoulders.
The hook’s life gurgled to hell.
While Peters life left in a sensation like flight
A sensation known to all that die.
A sensation known as release.
For Peter can fly.
He can fly he can fly.
Fin</div></div>
