<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Introduction
----------------Welcome fellow scribes! If you're reading this work you're probably wondering how to properly format a book for submition to the Terminus Library. If so, then read on!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-4" id="page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Getting Started
----------------Before anything else, you should download "Bookz Mod", which is a clientside mod to facilitate book writing and copying. Just Google for it and follow the installation instructions.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-5" id="page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Book Formatting
----------------You have probably noticed by now that we use special formatting characters like Bold and Italics. To do this, Google "Book and Quill" to find the wiki entry on it, then scroll down to "Special codes".</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-6" id="page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The First Page
----------------This book, like any other from the Terminus library, will have a special first page inserted before submittion to the library. This helps standardize our library, and make it easier to understand who transcribed the</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-7" id="page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">work and when. It may seem unnecessary, but consider how many books have been written in Civcraft, and then how many of them have been copied by someone else, then stolen, and copied again! To see how this works, turn the page:</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-8" id="page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content"><Original Work's Title Here>
----------------By <Author's Name>
-------------------Transcribed by <Your Name> on <Month> <Date>, <Year in Roman Numerals> at <Your Location>
-------------------TBI: <Terminus Book Identifier></div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-9" id="page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Terminus Book Identifier
----------------On the previous page, at the bottom, you likely noticed a spot for the TBI. This is a unique identifier that tells scribes where to place the books in our Terminus Literary Vaults. These vaults are a network of</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-10" id="page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">backup collections scattered across the world, to ensure if one falls, no books will be lost. Make sure to ask the Terminus Head Librarians (Currently Spacew00t and Oogalaboogala) for a TBI before signing your book. If they're not available, just leave it</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-11" id="page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">blank for the moment. A book will not be entered into the Terminus Literary Vaults until it has an TBI, so make sure to get one before making a ton of copies. They're worthless otherwise!</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-12" id="page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Signing the Book
----------------Once you've finished inserting the first page, you're ready to sign the book! Since the first page you've added already contains the original title, feel free to sign the book with a more descriptive title, as long as </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-13" id="page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">it remains true to the content of the book. 

For example, let's say the original work is signed:

"My Mining Journal"

Now, while that may have sufficed for the original author, it's not in the least bit</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-14" id="page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">descriptive enough to tell us what it's about! Let's say it starts out as a journal of them mining, but turns into a rant about the author getting mugged by a stranger. then an acceptable title could be:

"Mugged Miner"
</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-15" id="page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Now, this is a very subjective issue, so feel free to use the original title if you really can't think of a better title for the work. </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-16" id="page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Multi-Volume Works
----------------So all this formatting is fine and dandy, but lets say that, oh no, you've come across a multi-volume work or the book is already 40 pages long! Don't worry, just add v.1 to the end of the signed title, and v.2 to </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-17" id="page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 21</a><div class="page-content">the second volume, and so on. Each volume should have the same first page, in Terminus Transcription Format.

If the work is already 40 pages, then you'll have to turn it into a multivolume work. To do this, cut the last page, and paste it into a new book</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-18" id="page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">and use the guide for formatting multi-volume works.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-19" id="page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Contact Us
---------------- If you're interested in working, living, or visiting Terminus, please pm head librarians Spacew00t or OogalaBoogala.

We try to distribute our collection to any and all libraries for little to no cost, as</div></div>

Thanks for reading!</div></div>
