<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Back in times immemorial, in the Second Civ Era, During the Channic Golden Age, was a group of young revolutionaries. The Individualist Front, also known as the IDF, was a political front founded by a man named Ryan with the goal of eliminating the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 21</a><div class="page-content">corrupt Viridian National Front (VNF) regime, which used its paramilitary force, the Anti-Bully Rangers (ABR) to exert powers over the sovereign nation and fellow Chanadan Federation membe, Intis. Many had their reasons to join the IDF, both Viridianite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">and Intian alike. Nes was a Viridianite who joined the IDF shortly after its founding, having motive to liberate his city from VNF/ABR rule. Chris Chrispie (AKA Judas, more about that later) joined the IDF as the ABR monopoly was against his business</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">interests. Irish joined the IDF for his nationalistic views that Intis must be free. Tran joined the IDF for memes. Prioma fell in love with Nes and joined the IDF to get closer to Nes. Mob joined the IDF because he joined every orginization secretly in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">order to protect his business interests, which ultimately payed off for him. Conor was recruited by Nes post-exile during the brief Benistan Days. Now, with the members covered, into the history. Ryan originally intended to call his organization the PF,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">but what PF abbreviated was lost to history, as Ryan never had written down exactly what PF meant. It is theorized it could have meant Progressive Front. Ultimately, in the first IDF council meeting, the name Individualist Front was chosen, and IDF soon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">became the shorthand name. In the meeting was concluded that Kovio must go. Ryan and the IDF took a radical turn during the Intis/Viridian land dispute when Kovio slaughtered innocent Intians who were protesting in solidarity with a horse farmer settled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">between Intis and Viridian. It was decided then that Kovio must go. Now with Chris, the IDF ran for seats in the Intis government. Ryan and Chris would hold governmental seats. Nes unsuccessfully ran for the Viridian government. Eventually the IDF</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">realized that they would be unable to win rigged elections in Viridian and would need to call on foreign intervention. Chris was eager for foreign business contacts and wanted to secure Trade Deals with Intis and foreigners. The peace envoy to Mt. Agusta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">was somewhat of a disaster remembered as being fun but counter-productive. Non-IDF Intis citizens such as Disake were in attendence when Nes jokingly told Tran to burn down the flag of Mt. Agusta. The fucking madman actually did it! The resulting mess</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">was quick to clear up fortunately. After that, the Chanadan federation passed laws against peace envoys from subject nations (Intis and Viridian), so to get around this the IDF had its own political peace envoys, and Chris secured trade deals.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Mt. Agusta had pledged support to an IDF revolt. There was growing suspicion among the Kovian regieme that an IDF revolt was brewing, as the IDF had more and more foreign contacts. Prioma then joined the IDF, and as Viridian's minister of Resource</div></div>

She gave the IDF insider information and had access to the ABR tower. Nes went on Trial, accused of conspiracy to treason by Kovio. Manabee would be his defence lawyer and the case would be judged by a foreign</div></div>

During the middle of the Nes trial, with everyone else in power occupied, Prioma went into the ABR tower one last time, and decided to, as resource manager, appropriate the resources for use by the IDF. The IDF quickly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">called on it's allies in Mt. Agusta to send assistance, and Ryan ran off with the resources. The next day, before any foreign aid could arrive, Kovio showed up at Priome, a temporary IDF settlement not far from Mob's claim. Prioma was bountied as she had</div></div>

Rather than be pearled, Ryan complied with Kovio's orders, handed the resources over, and went into exile around with Nes. Irish and Chris</div></div>

Intis would end up primarily owned by Irish and Chris as more and more property became abandoned. Ryan, Nes, and (secretly) Prioma. A week into the exile in Benistan Ryan accidently revealed he and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Nes were harbouring Prioma, causing Kovio to bounty Ryan and Nes. Ryan and Nes would be duped into walking into a trap by their supposed allies of Hjaltland. Ryan and Nes would never forgive Sylveir or Devon for such trechary. Ryan would spend a week in</div></div>

Ultimately the IDF would distance a bit as Nes went off to found Chanos with Irish while Ryan retired mysteriously into hiding for some time, and periods of contact and scilence went</div></div>

Nes had for a time completely cut contact with Ryan, only for it to be restored months later as Ryan bumped into Hghg. Irish and Ryan had maintained scarce contact throughout the whole time. The age of Devoted would come</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 21</a><div class="page-content">and Irish would speak with Nes since the first time he was betrayed back in Chanos. Though Nes would be dissapointed that Ryan and Irish would opt to join Chanada rather than his operation, they decided to remain personal friends. And that is the IDF tale</div></div>
