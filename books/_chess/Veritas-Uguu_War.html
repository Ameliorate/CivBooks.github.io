<span class="fmt0">Ex-Veritas Leader</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Since the start of the world, Uguu has been a nation committed to imprisoning raiders, griefers and other threats to the server. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Their reason for doing this stemmed from the actions of an old group, The Pirates, in the last map, who managed to prolong</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 36</a><div class="page-content">wars for so long, many people logged off the server and didn't come back. Through either fear or helplessness, The Pirates managed to kill the server when a stalemate between The Pirates and a nation called Agora appeared.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Many of the Pirates players</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 36</a><div class="page-content">belonged to a larger group called Aegis, a group which many people now had a big dislike and distrust for.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">When civcraft 3.0 ended, Aegis did not migrate to Devoted like mostly everyone else did. However, a lot of their players created their own much</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 36</a><div class="page-content">smaller nation, Veritas. Coni_s2, HiImPosey and myself were the three leaders of Veritas, and due to preexisiting grudges coming from other civservers, grew to become the natural rival to Uguu's power, a much larger and more powerful group existing in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 36</a><div class="page-content">nether biomes.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Veritas disagreed with Uguu's policing of the server, saying it was unfair to pearl a new player for their actions on another server. However, another reason Veritas disagreed was because Uguu were targetting and killing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 36</a><div class="page-content">most of Veritas' friends, who had turned to the raider playstyle and creating havok in a lot of towns.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Although Veritas did not aid the players once they had begun raiding, the raiders had got most of their valuable armor from Veritas before they started</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 36</a><div class="page-content">to attack towns, and therefore a lot of people, especially Uguu and their allies, became suspicious about the legitimacy of Veritas.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It did not help that HiImPosey was pearled by Uguu for breaking a vault containing raiders that Uguu had caught. Veritas</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 36</a><div class="page-content">was unsure about the fate of their leader, worrying that because of the old grudges and distrust between the two groups, Posey would not be freed.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Outside of the game, a lot of talks about breaking Posey out of the vault commenced, some talks with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 36</a><div class="page-content">raider friends Veritas had. Due to permissions on the discord being set wrong and an invite link being abused, Veritas' supposedly private chats were leaked to the entire server by Uguu.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">However, it is questionable whether or not this leaks were actually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 36</a><div class="page-content">incriminating. A lot of players at the time were understandably angry that Veritas had discussed these issues with the people who had attacked their towns, but at the same time understood that friends will talk to friends about their plans. It seemed like</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 36</a><div class="page-content">it hadn't really changed many people's minds. The people allied with Veritas continued to support them, and the people who distrusted Veritas started to distrust them even more.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">As time progressed, the tension, at least in Veritas, increased.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 36</a><div class="page-content">We became certain that at some point, we would be attacked and started to prepare for the worst. There were several reasons for this:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">One Uguu player, poortea, with a history of trespassing in Veritas land attacked Coni_s2 on the border of the nations</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 36</a><div class="page-content">on the suspicion that Coni_s2 was illegally snitching Uguu land. Veritas placed a bounty of 128d on poortea, and AdminCrimes - still Uguu leader - handed in the pearl himself. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">A week or so later, again at the border of the nations, Coni_s2 was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 36</a><div class="page-content">threatened to be killed and logboxed when she was making the wall on the Veritas side of the border.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It seemed like the peaceful period was about to end for the two nations, and Veritas kept hearing rumours that Uguu were about to attack their vault</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 36</a><div class="page-content">at "the end of the month," "on thanksgiving," and "on the day after thanksgiving."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">However, one major turning point was when Uguu's private discord was leaked this time, revealing their plans to attack Veritas on the 25th of November 2016.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Uguu claimed the server was dying, due to it's exhaustive tech tree and increasing boredom with not being able to progress upon it. A couple of days earlier, Uguu player Soerxpso had left his nation, becoming a raider with friend Rixxlon. Eventually,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 36</a><div class="page-content">other Uguu player Futtt_Bucker joined the pair, creating a small raider group. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The Discord leaks also proved that the raider group were telling the rest of Uguu what they should be writing in their posts about them. Although similar</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 36</a><div class="page-content">to the Veritas leaks, the Uguu's discord revealed a much more destructive nation than people had anticipated. The screenshots showed many prominent members of Uguu discussing "giving up and going evil" and their plans to raid and grief Veritas, freeing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 36</a><div class="page-content">poortea by breaking the Veritas vault.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">These leaks were posted on the 25th of November 2016, an hour before the given attack time, and gave most of the server time to help the side they thought were in the right.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Server opinion swayed towards Veritas after seeing the intentions of Uguu to attack a town that had been relatively peaceful and had kept to itself, and as a result Uguu got many offers from help, most notably from the Chanadians.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The attack was delayed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 36</a><div class="page-content">by an hour.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Eventually, at around 4:30pm EST, the Uguu forces, their allies, and their supporters marched on Veritas in their attempt to break the vault, and to deplete Veritas of all it's stored valuables, wiping out the nation and their main threat on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 36</a><div class="page-content">this server.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The war started quickly, and soon many players from both sides were pearled, with Veritas holding 6 pearls and Uguu holding 4 at the end of the first assault. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The attacks continued in waves, each time would bring 1 or 2 new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 36</a><div class="page-content">imprisoned players. But it was only until the second assault when things begun to look bad for Veritas.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">One of Veritas' best fighters, Reiko, was pearled when he lagged out during a fight. Although some Veritas members claimed this was a DDOS attack on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Reiko, no evidence could back this up, and so it was an unlucky moment, and one which was just the beginning of the end of the nation.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Later, Uguu attacked again in full force, pearling 5 more players whilst barely losing any.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 36</a><div class="page-content">In the Veritas discord, everyone had given up. The war was over however way it was looked at. Uguu had begun to break the vault and disable resupply bunkers and victory posts were made by AdminCrimes.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">However, this was not the end for Veritas.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 36</a><div class="page-content">With only 4 defenders against an attack force of 14 players, Veritas managed to somehow pearl 8 attackers without losing a single pearl due to Uguu mistakes and resiliance to back down to retreat. Eventually, when Uguu retreated, the full meaning of that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 36</a><div class="page-content">victory sunk in for Veritas. We realised they only had 5 or 6 players left to attack. Or, more importantly, 6 players left to defend their vaults which prisoners of war had been put in.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Uguu's fatal mistake of not backing off once a couple of their group</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 36</a><div class="page-content">were pearled eventually cost them the war. Several were pearled because of the ladders around Veritas' vault that they had become stuck on, and shitposting on the subreddit turned up in full force.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Over the next day, Veritas launched a counter attack on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Uguu's vault to release some of their fighters pearled whilst defending their homeland. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">From Uguu, SirCrowley and Sovakat were captured, and the war was lost.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Veritas needn't break the rest of the vault because Uguu began</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 36</a><div class="page-content">to drop the pearls at their feet, and the Veritas defenders were free. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Shitposting and celebrations began to drown the subreddit, videos about the heroic fight in the 4v14, jokes about AdminCrimes' posts on the subreddit, and images showing the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 36</a><div class="page-content">defenders as icons, cementing their place in history. For all intents and purposes, the war had been won.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">One question on a lot of people's minds now turns towards Veritas. What will they do next? Will a lot of them quit once they realise the same fate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 36</a><div class="page-content">as Uguu? Will they begin to raid as Uguu predicted? Or will they try and replace Uguu as the policing force on the server?<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It's not clear yet what the aims of Veritas are, but it can be assured that the server will be watching them with a very eager eye.</div></div>
