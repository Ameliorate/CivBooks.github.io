<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I used to play this game with myself where I'd try to get from my house to the park and back at midnight without getting seen by anybody.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The appeal of urbex is partially about the furtiveness of it, the feeling of doing something secretive in the dark. The actual</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 39</a><div class="page-content">consequences of getting caught trespassing on a disused property aren't really that big of a deal in this country–it's not a criminal offence or anything–but you're not really thinking about that when you're lurking around a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 39</a><div class="page-content">construction site or a disused building or an old railway tunnel in the dead of the night. It feels like there’s stakes. You're painfully aware of every tiny sound and movement, you start looking at the city differently.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Normally urban life is all</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

But when you're trespassing, you're primarily thinking in terms of cover, vulnerability, and stealth. A short journey becomes an arduous,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 39</a><div class="page-content">stressful task. In daylight, the walk from my front door to the park took about 20 minutes. Under cover of night, playing by the rules of the stealth game, it took at least twice as long (and sometimes longer). A lot of it depended on how cautious I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 39</a><div class="page-content">was feeling that night.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When you travel around like this, you inevitably develop a new kind of appreciation for the city–not just in terms of the way that you see the terrain but also in the impression you get of its inhabitants. I saw</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

I can recall a couple of occasions where I saw people I knew during the daytime. Locking eyes, that flash of recognition, of realising that this figure standing in the shadows is somebody who</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 39</a><div class="page-content">sits in front of you in lectures, who greets you at the supermarket, who plays football with you on weekends–it felt like seeing a ghost. I have a very vivid memory of walking up a steep, narrow street and making eye contact with a girl who was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 39</a><div class="page-content">sitting cross-legged on a skateboard and gliding down the middle of the empty road. I'm fairly sure it happened, but I can't be certain. The whole thing was so odd and slow, time seemed to move the way it does in dreams.

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 39</a><div class="page-content">chemical thing maybe, something primal. Recreational trespass is a way of tapping into vestigial emotions from the times when our ancestors lived in caves or slept on the cold ground, scared for their fucking lives. I told my psychiatrist that</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The least interesting kinds of tunnels you find on CivRealms are the ones you're meant to see–quarries, transportation tunnels, whatever. The real fun starts when you enter into the murky world</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 39</a><div class="page-content">of unmarked tunnel networks, threaded through one another underneath the overworld and the AN. It's not that hard to get into one of these by accident, but I've never been able to discover one intentionally. Looking for shit like that pretty much</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">guarantees that you'll get frustrated.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>These kinds of tunnels are mostly unlit 2x1 passageways, and they have a tendency to wind around in seemingly irrational ways. They have a way of making themselves</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">concealed, easy to pass by. After all, who has the time to be checking out every random little tunnel they find? For me, the idea of walking for thousands of blocks down a shitty little tunnel without knowing where it's going or if it even goes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 39</a><div class="page-content">anywhere is off-putting at the best of times.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, in my experience following these tunnels invariably leads you into weird places. The actual experience of exploring these things is deeply unnerving. Sometimes you find evidence</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 39</a><div class="page-content">of the people who dug these things–a chest full of cobble here, a crafting table there. Less often, you'll find items lying on the ground, or a piece of redstone ore in the floor that's still glowing from having been stepped on. The rational</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 39</a><div class="page-content">interpretation for stuff like this is that the person who dug this tunnel never came back again, that it was a single-use kind of deal. However, encountering stuff like this in the moment is creepy. There's always a lingering sense of unease,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 39</a><div class="page-content">and a lot of that stems from the fundamental ambiguity of the situation. It's hard to avoid asking yourself questions like, am I supposed to be here? Have I uncovered a secret I wasn't meant to see? Will being found in this tunnel get me</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You may laugh, but when you've been walking for thousands of blocks in the dark, your mind starts to play tricks on you. And sometimes, that paranoia is</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

I somehow managed to avoid getting pearled for it, but it's very hard to convey what it felt like to emerge from that tunnel unscathed, look around, and slowly figure out what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 39</a><div class="page-content">kind of a predicament I was in. Put yourself in that situation. You'd be paranoid too.
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>III.</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I once found a stash of stolen methadone and hypodermic needles in a disused tunnel under a golf course. I once found an e4u3 mithril pickaxe in an unlit</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 39</a><div class="page-content">2x1 tunnel in the AN. Emotionally speaking, these two experiences were almost identical. The only distinction between these moments was a tactile one–the actual physical experience of being in a dark tunnel isn't the same as seeing a dark</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 39</a><div class="page-content">tunnel on your screen. But the tactile distinction vanishes as these moments recede into memory, and all that's left to recall is the intensity of the realisation, that paranoia, the feeling of not being on solid ground.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The basic terror of exploration is the uncertainty over whether or not the exploratory space will eventually coagulate into familiar ground.
