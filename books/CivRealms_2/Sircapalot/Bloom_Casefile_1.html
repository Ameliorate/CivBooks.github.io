<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the afternoon of May 13th, I found myself in a precarious situation — my horse had disappeared from the horse pit at the Darkforest Manor construction site.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Investigations immediately began with an audit of all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 24</a><div class="page-content">my snitches in the area, which revealed that an individual by the name of ChocolateNova had mounted an entity and broken out of the horse pit. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I then messaged the fellow about the matter to which he responded that he did take the horses. However, during</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content">this process, I discovered my horse grazing on the grassy slopes behind the manor; it had simply wandered out the pit!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But, this still doesn't explain the entity mounted in the pit?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then, suddenly, a revelation; earlier this day, I, slushhi,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">and TheCatofTens had been building the section of the MTA-Bloom-CivCorp Road near the manor. Slushhi left with his horse to deal with other business after, but TheCatofTens simply logged off in the pit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was then when I decided to ask if the horse</div></div>

My deductions were correct — Cat's horse was the one stolen.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I had expected that problem resolved when ChocolateNova apologized and promised to return the horse, so I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">contacted TheCatofTens on Discord and arranged for him to receive it back at the manor.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Things really took a turn when ChocolateNova proceeded to call TheCatofTens a fascist and decided to keep the horse.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Any reader who is familiar</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">with newfriend crimes on Civ servers would know what came next — TheCatofTens posted a 10 stamina bounty on ChocolateNova, with 5 more if the horse is returned. Many Heads of States were contacted too in case of ChocolateNova passing through their lands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">ChocolateNova, intimidated by bounty, eventually broke down into bargaining. Cat was merciful in his terms: return the horse and walk free. To this, ChocolateNova agreed but however instructed Cat to pick up the horse at his location.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In retrospect, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">know not what ChocolateNova was thinking. What kind of imbecile would fall for that?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Of course, TheCatofTens refused and told ChocolateNova to return the horse to Bloom, after which ChocolateNova logged off for the night, last seen in Norlund.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">At this point in time, I joked that ChocolateNova could have been an Alex_Cristal alt, a similar raider who, back on CivClassics, attempted to deceive officials of the Bloomian Republic only to be deceived himself and pearled. TheCatofTens, who was a part</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">of the council that delt with alex_cristal's case, noted that this could very well be a possibility as no normal person will go around and call people 'fascist' for no good reason. After some account research, however, no ties were found between the two.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"><span class="fmtcode">§5</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>May 14th<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The day of May 14th was pretty uneventful; we received no further information on ChocolateNova's whereabouts. However, Patar did inform us that ChocolateNova was a part of a group known as the Inca, which, from what I can tell,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">was a group that conducted at least 1 major grief on the server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>To force a reaction out of ChocolateNova, TheCatofTens and I increased the bounty to 20 stamina in total. Surprisingly, this had no effect until the evening.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Augustans would know that in the evening of May 14th, the voter tree in the capital and several surrounding buildings were set alight by Boris Seperatists. As soon as I heard about the news, I went to witness it myself. Indeed, it was a haunting sight,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After the exchange occured, ChocolateNova began bargaining once more,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">claiming that he and his friend <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>(popap100)<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> were new to the server and were having trouble, apparently "overwhelmed" and "kept dying." He then claimed that the trek back to Bloom would be too dangerous and neither his friend or the horse would survive.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">More lies. How did he make it all the way to Norlund from Bloom if it was so dangerous? TheCatofTens was sick of it at this point , and issued an ultimatum: deliver the horse to Bloom, or stay pearled. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>No futher contact occured on this day.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Nobody expected Popap100 to actually return Expedience to Bloom.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>During the afternoon, Slushhi and I were frolicking around the capital, a rider approached with Expedience. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">I texted TheCatofTens to log in and the exchange happened without incident. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>You'd expect the story to end here, but newfriends will be newfriends.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I went to check on my treefarm for around 10 minutes after the exchange and popap100 was still in</div></div>
