<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Know that I am your God, and that the Great Circle is my symbol. "</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Confused, the fold of Accelarius went to their elder for his advice, and he answered thus:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"My fold, who I love as much as He loves me, the Holy One doesn't come to you when you wish him to come. The Holy One is all there is, so</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Be not afraid if he answers not for many nights. Only He knows when it is right to speak, and when it is right to remain silent.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The fold of Accelarius thanked him, and kept their heart upon to the Godliness there was all around them.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Many moons after, sleep - once again - fell over the Acceleradans. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Finally, to the joy of many, and the fear of those who were not righteous, the voice once again roared through their heads, bodies and souls.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In the morning the tribe of Accelarius was silent - For they needed not utter a sinlge word. All that needed to be said was said.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The March to Accelerada seemed to be endless, but it was all carried out in silence. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There was no words left to speak. No words were needed.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Upon reaching the mountain, the fold of Accelarius heard the voice of the One Who Reigns Above again. But this was the first time they heard him, while they were awake.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Acceleradans bore their elder to the mountain, and gave him a knife.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Accelarius proclaimed thusly:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The tribe of Accelarius was frightened</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They lived at the base of Mount Accelerada, and lived happily there.</div></div>
