<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Occasionally one would comment on how well the cows were breeding, & others on the influx of lovely ponies.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The animals looked up into the sky & admired the god looking down on them, acknowledging the gods existence & power.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Shortly after the cows & ponies found a weird looking purple/black night sky in a small patch of the ground. Curiosity led them too close & suddenly they descended into the realm of darkness, of tears & </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The animals tried desperately to dig their way out of this terrible darkness. Down, they dug. Down, hastily looking for the way out.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The god could no longer withhold his wrath & sent small biting critters, scarabs, to try & keep the ponies & cows in check. </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But the cows & ponies just became smarter in the way they evaded the scarabs, & </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The god passed a law that sent twice as many scarabs to the underworld at those desecrating the sight. But the cows & ponies fought back.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The god felt bad & realised in a way the war was futile, the cows and ponies seemed to find an answer for all he threw at them. So the god passed a law reducing once again the amount the scarabs </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The god did acknowledge that the ponies & cows were a worthy opponent. The animals & the gods were satisfied with their titillating battle.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
