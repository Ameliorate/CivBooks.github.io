<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Varathia, by population and size, is one of the largest nations in the world. It is a monarchy with a small parliament, and is one of the first to adopt a standard currency, the International Credit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">country, it is the largest city in the empire. It has natural subdivisions across the city, and you can tell where one begins and one ends rather easily. Notable structures include the Nuktuk statue and the Palace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">--==MOLOKA==--<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Moloka is a heavily devout nation based off the society of the same name. They even have a nice, short legend about the forked river near their city, Braxos.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Braxos==--<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A small city, it is a simply beautiful, if cramped, city. It has</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">one, solid theme that it keeps throughout the city. The most notable thing about the city is not any building, however, but the river just outside, and the tale it has to tell.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">--==NORLUND==--<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A nation far to the north, Norlund is a true parliamentary monarchy, with a prime minister and king both acting as heads of state. It too has adopted a currency, the krun, and has a booming carrot industry, with fields upon fields of them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Konnin==--<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>If you make the treacherous journey across the barren wastes just outside, a difficult task even on horseback, you will be greeted with a pleasant, small city. It has a unified theme, but without the crampedness of Moloka. Notable places</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">include the island castle for its sheer aesthetic and the "Poppy" tavern and inn.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A country with a large landmass, it is an unfortunate truth that most of it is mountainous. There is no real government, though this is more for lack of description than anarchism. Its capital city shares the country's name. This city</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">certainly has room to grow, and though it has no single unified theme, it is still rather pretty. That being said, however, the only building of true note is the local castle.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A country located on a river, the local dictatorship is hostile to visitors like you and I. In trying to visit the city, they stated they were not open for visitation.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As the name would suggest, Wheatistan is the land of wheat. It is run by a parliament, and is a sizable nation, population and sizewise.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A sizable city itself, it could be theoretically argued that the city is split</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">in twain between the urban areas and the vast farmlands surrounding. Places of note include the Mall, Parliament and the truly enormous bridge.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Interdimensional Council of Ricks, or ICOR, is a relatively small nation. As the name suggests, it is run by three Ricks in an oligarchy.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Citadel of Ricks is the capitol of ICOR. It is a small town, but like many other</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">small towns, it suffers from not having much of note. However, the land surrouding COR is quite grand, with mountains around almost every flank. The roads are also some of the nicest I've seen.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Carbon is, by far, the most wide-reaching nation in the world, with a colony on almost every landmass. It is a constitutional monarchy. Its capitol shares the name, just tacking "City of " to the front. It is a hodgepodge of buildings, with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">internal divisions that don't seem to signify anything and seem more randomly placed, were it not for the terrain. The terrain itself is hostile to the eye as well, and the path to the city proper might as well be the diagram of the digestive tract. There</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">--==The Commune==-- The Commune is a small place based on the river. It is anarcho-communist, and as such has no state or economy. It is run by a pure democracy. The capitol which shares its name is not technologically advanced, and there isn't much to</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 24</a><div class="page-content">And there you have it, a guide to many of the most major nations in the world, and a few smaller ones.
