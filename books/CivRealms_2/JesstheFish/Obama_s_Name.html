<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was a dark and stormy night when she came in. I didn't know her; she wasn't a regular client of mine, but she said she had a job for me. I'm a private eye, in Washington DC, and business had been slow. It also helped that the job had a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">high offer associated with it. Forty thousand dollars.... all to find out the last name of President Obama. An easy task, I'd thought, but as  soon as I accepted the offer, the woman fled from my office, scared of someone coming after her, it seemed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">I began my search - where else - on the Internet. However, despite this being the President of the United States, nothing came up. Not one search result for "Obama's last name," even after 10 seconds of searching. Fine, looks like I had to go to where it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">had to be. If anyone knew the President's last name, it was a buddy of mine down at the Underdark Pub - the place to go if you needed to disappear. I arranged a meeting with the informant there. His name was... I actually never found out his name. He</div></div>

Glass from windows scattered across a floor now covered with a mix of blood, alcohol and bodies. Among them, the tavern keeper and my informant, Harambe.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The question now - why hadn't they waited until I arrived? I assumed they already knew where I lived, so I couldn't go there. There was one lead I still had, though - the White House itself. I was a good</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">asked him.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"We've been watching you. You're getting too nosy. Keep out of this." he replied.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Why? You got some kinda stake in this?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"We can't afford Obama's last name being leaked. Not until he gets out of office."</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I'd heard enough. I quickly grabbed the gun from his hand and took it from him. He threw a</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I didn't have much time now. I needed to find out Obama's last name, and quick. I continued down on my way to the White House, still hoping I could get some answers and make sense of</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When I arrived, security was tight. Tighter than under Bush, anyway. After many long conversations with many guards in the dead of night, I finally made my way into the Oval Office. Rifling through papers, flashlight in hand, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">read the name on every document I could find. Every single one read Mr. Obama, or President Obama, until finally, I found his birth certificate. Obama. Obama Care. As soon as I read the words on the page, the windows broke open, and Anons came pouring in.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"End of the line, detective. You shoulda just stayed out of all this."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm actually a P.I., and it doesn't matter, Q! I know Obama's last name, and as soon as I hit 'tweet' the world will know too!" I held up my phone, threateningly,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Do you REALLY believe his name is 'Obama Care'? Obama IS his last name, dumbass! I told him to keep that around just for someone like you! And now, it's something you'll take to your grave."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Then, a gunshot. I flinched, bracing myself, but I felt nothing. I reopened my eyes, and the only person out here with blood on them was QAnon. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I turned around, and there he was - President Obama, though  I still didn't know his first name.</div></div>
