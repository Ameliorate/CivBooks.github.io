<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The parameters of grapes are, as of the writing of this study, not well known. As such, this study will discuss the growth of grapes on various materials.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For the experiment, researchers took a 6m x 3m growing space from which to harvest the grapes. The grapes were grown on oak wood, stone and air at the coords of 2485X, 30Y, -6262Z. All vines were grown naturally and none were placed.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The grapes were initially planted on a row 1m above the harvesting area. When the grapes had grown down the entire surface, they were harvested. A yield of a grape was considered a success, while a vine yield or no yield was considered a</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>On oak wood, there was a success rate average of 80.2%, with the highest yield being 94.4%, the lowest being 61.6%, a median yield of 83.3%, and lacking a real mean yield.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>On air, the average success rate was 84.89%, a range of 61.1%-94.4%, a median of 83.3%, and a mean split between 83.3% and 94.4%. It is notable to mention, however, that the air tests had results</div></div>

If you harvest too high on the vines, all lower vines will drop with no drops at all; however, on air harvests, almost no item drops were lost.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At the end of the day, there seems to be no correlation between yield rates and material grown on; however, there are other ways present in the results that are good to keep in mind while growing. From this study, I would say</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">that the best material to grow grapes and vines on is air.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>While writing the first study, it had come to researcher's attention that there may be a difference in where grapes are planted. So, Commune researchers have designed this second study using results from the first study, as well as a new subject</div></div>

Researchers have hypothesised that, in the current location of the Commune, there will not be much change in the yield rates; however, other studies may have different results. We encourage replication of this study in other locations.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As I'm sure you can tell, these are doodoo numbers. The River biome, it can be confirmed, is not a good biome to grow grapes in. I'm not sure, however, if this result extends to all biomes or not.</div></div>
