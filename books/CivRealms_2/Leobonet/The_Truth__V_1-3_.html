<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>1.1 In the days of old, Light beset our world and created existence itself, from the dark abyss of which the world derived from. It was as if existence itself said: “Let there be Light”, and thus Light there was.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.2 But what is light without its natural counterpart? And so, the Light let darkness be the keeper of those which the Light did not reach.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.3 The Light was weak, and had not yet developed into its true form, as such, darkness acted on its opportunity and seized half of the world and infested it with its growing corruption. It was the first time The Light didn’t reach its creation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.4 An intense duel, of night and day begun. With millennia passing and The Light growing ever stronger, won. But with the price of never being able to fully annihilate darkness. As such it created a lesser light, to watch over its creation while at rest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.5 The question remained, what was the meaning of existence if there was none to appreciate it? And such The Light shined across vast lakes, mountains and fields. Bustling with life and energy.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.6 Yet none truly appreciated its creations. Thus the Light created a creature to breathe the air, fish its fish, mine its mines, plow its field and make use of what is and will be. With this dominion, The Light truly became appreciated.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">1.7 The Light shone upon what was made, and behold, the world was great.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2.1 But this world, with all of its wonders took time creating. And time is the lights most fearsome enemy, until the eternal darkness arrives.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">2.2 Thus the light used the last of its dying light, and manifested itself in the form of a person, God himself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">2.3 As God rose, the dark yet again retreated to the depths below the deepest of bedrock.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2.4 His birthplace, due to the sheer sacrosanctity became the Sun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">2.5 The Sun tasked with guarding the day during Gods absence, performed its task dutifully, without fail.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>2.6 Yet God wasn't pleased, for darkness still roamed the land. Due to the nature of light, he could not see during the night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">2.7 So God used his power and punched a hole in the night sky and let the lesser light shine through, the Moon and its moonlight with Gods watchful eye shone upon the world.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3.1 But who to appreciate this world apart from me?, God explained and thus The Deities were created from all the worlds different elements.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">3.2 Yet this was not enough, for these are arbritrary deities and God wanted genuine appreciation for this wondrous world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">3.3 With the best of intentions, he created his most perfect creation yet, modelled after Gods own form. It was the first of men, the first of many. Steve.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">3.4 Steve, like God became lonely in the neverending world. He exclaimed to God "Now you have me, but who have I?". God doubted his actions for the first time, yet he was willing to barter a deal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">3.5 Thy will appreciate me til the end of times and you will give up thy immortality, in return I will give you my world, the gift of death and you a people.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">3.6 Thus Steve never roamed the world alone again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
