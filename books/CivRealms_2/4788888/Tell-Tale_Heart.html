The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded— with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">nights—every night just at midnight—but I found the eye was always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that I drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out—"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the mean—</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">time I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; —just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself—"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, to envelope the victim.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head within the room.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily— until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">eye. It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well I have told you that I am so nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with muffled sound.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught it all—ha! ha!

<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled—for what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: —It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">continued and gained definiteness—until at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; —but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased— and what could I do? It was a low, dull,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly— more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? Ipaced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I foamed —I raved —I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder —louder —louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it</div></div>
