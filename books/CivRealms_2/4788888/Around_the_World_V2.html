Tiny, wooden shantytowns were cropped up along the riverside, and a small handful of somber players stared out at me from them. I realized their struggle, and sympathized for them.

A multicolored form was sitting right on the beach about 100 meters away, so I went over to inspect it. It was a parrot! Having lived in a frozen tundra all my life, I hardly recognized such an animal, but I could tell he desired companionship and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 44</a><div class="page-content">that I was the first player he had ever seen. I needed a crew mate, anyhow, and felt bad that he had to live on a side of the country which no one visits, so I picked him up and called him Wilhelm.

As we made it out of the harbor and onto the open waters, he flew this way and that around the boat, peering over the horizon for land. The sun began to set on the tranquil</div></div>

It was dumping down rain-we had been caught in one of those ocean typhoons-and I had no intentions to let that thing get near my boat. I dug in on the oars and we were off.
