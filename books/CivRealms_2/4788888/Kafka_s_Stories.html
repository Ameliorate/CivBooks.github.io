<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">fact that the calculations involved were no less onerous, just more trivial, since great Poseidon was only in line for an executive post.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Before the law sits a gatekeeper. To this gatekeeper comes a man from the country who asks to gain entry into the law. But the gatekeeper says that he cannot grant him entry at the moment. The man thinks about it and then asks if</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At the moment the gate to the law stands open, as always, and the gatekeeper walks to the side, so the man bends over in order to see through the</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">gate into the inside. When the gatekeeper notices that, he laughs and says:

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"If it tempts you so much, try it in spite of my prohibition. But take note: I am powerful. And I am only the most lowly gatekeeper. But from room to room stand gatekeepers,</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The man from the country has not expected such difficulties: the law should always be accessible for everyone, he thinks, but as he now looks more closely at the</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

The gatekeeper gives him a stool and allows him to sit down at the side in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">front of the gate. There he sits for days and years. He makes many attempts to be let in, and he wears the gatekeeper out with his requests. The gatekeeper often interrogates him briefly, questioning him about his homeland and many other things, but they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">are indifferent questions, the kind great men put, and at the end he always tells him once more that he cannot let him inside yet.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I am taking this only so that you do not think you have failed to do anything."</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

He curses the unlucky circumstance, in the first years thoughtlessly and out loud, later, as he grows old, he still mumbles to himself. He becomes childish and, since in the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>According to the first he was clamped to a rock in the Caucasus for betraying the secret of the gods to men, and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver, which was perpetually renewed.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>According to the third his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years, forgotten</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
