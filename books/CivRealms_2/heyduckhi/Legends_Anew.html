<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>      A critical reading of Narwhal_19's unknown, but recently uncovered 'Legends of Old'</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Narwhal_19's novel, Legends of Old begins with the chapter-title "Goddess of Whedonna". From this it is already clear that this novel intends to perpetuate divine notions into the origin of the land in which he wrote, at this time, Wheatistan.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">The book follows an embellished history of the world as imagined and constructed by the author, manufacturing a sense of awe as to this land. The implications of this are clear, for this serves the purpose of enticing the readers to treat their land with</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Whedonna's "killing" of the God of Fire after his attack proves the true power of this deity over her subjects, instilling obedience into her disciples. Further, the characterisation of her giving "birth" to </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As will later be further shown, it is already clear that the fundemental purpose of the text is to demand loyalty of the </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
