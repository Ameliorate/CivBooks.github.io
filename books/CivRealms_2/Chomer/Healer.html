<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He led me past a tractor rusting in the rain, pushed aside chickens with his foot and opened the door to his little house. Inside, bleak light fell through dirty windows.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"How much you gonna charge?" he asked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">The house was cluttered with dirty cooking tools and heaps of unwashed laundry. A new chaotic rice-cooker and a clunky media player sat on a wood countertop. He wore a blue phototropic shirt. Typical burgeoning bourgeois.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"How much you gonna charge?" he repeated.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Where is she?" I asked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He led me into a back room. His wife lay on a simple bed. She smiled wanly, her eyes only for her husband. "Zensheu," she said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Zensheu nodded toward his wife. "You need to fix her," he said. "She needs to make sons and clean."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I pulled a chair to her bedside, set down my bag. Zensheu stood watching.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">His wife had dark circles under her eyes, but her pale skin was unblemished. She was lovely. "I'm Wenwen," she said.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm here to heal you," I said, and she smiled a brilliant smile through sad eyes. "I need you to take off your blouse."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Zensheu didn't move so I helped Wenwen sit up. She slowly removed her blouse.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm paying someone to feel my wife's titties?" Zensheu asked, his arms folded across his chest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Wenwen's right breast was swollen along the radial midline. The skin there was dark. "May I?" I asked her, and when she nodded I used my fingertips to probe along the distention. I could feel a mass.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"You one of those livelong guys?" Zensheu asked. "You gonna live forever on my money?" I raised Wenwen's arm and felt along her chest, up to her armpit. The lymph nodes were swollen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"You fucking corporados," Zensheu said. "You squeeze poor farmers, you fix our breaks and bruises and live forever." I pulled the assay unit from my bag and ran it along the distention. Wenwen winced as the probe extended and snapped back.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I set it aside.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"That's it?" Zensheu said. "I owe a bag of gold?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Nothing he said was true. I learned my craft online, bought my gear second-hand in Beijing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I saved for months for my first kilo of nano, and rode my bike through the district. I made just enough to support my wife and I.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The livelong nano was for the rich, and would never, ever, be mine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I poured ten grams from the nanosite canister onto the palette. I turned on the transceiver and plugged it into the assay unit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">While the unit turned diagnostic data into machine code and passed it to the transceiver, I pushed aside a small portion of nano, shielded it with my knife, and then passed the transceiver over the rest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">This nano would eat Wenwen's tumor, and follow the metastasized cells along the highway of her lymph system.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I punched a different code into the assay unit, fed it to the transceiver, and passed it over the portion I had shielded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">That nano would live in her womb forever, killing male zygotes.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I pushed the nano together into a single pile, scraped it up with a wooden spoon, and fed it to Wenwen. She grimaced at the taste of carbon, and swallowed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Outside, the rain still fell. Zensheu approached from the side of the house, and held out a chicken. The chicken was scrawny, its legs deformed. "Here's your pay," he said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I took the chicken from him, and slammed its head into the side of the tractor. I threw it in the mud and walked off, into the rain.</div></div>
