<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Today they announced that robots have been a thing for years now, and we never knew. It's hard to believe, but apparently we've been living in a sci-fi world for years and they never told us. Robots integrated into people's lives</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 37</a><div class="page-content">for years now, and yet not even a trace, not an ounce of skepticism was heard on the news beforehand. How did this go under my nose for so long? I've always kept my eyes open for something strange, and yet for them just to appear? It just...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 37</a><div class="page-content">it doesn't make sense</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Apparently, they were sent out in a small group of just 200, groups of four sent to all fifty states of the U.S. for a test run to see how they would react to normal life. Apparently they did well, as now they've sent out another</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 37</a><div class="page-content">group of them again, this time with our knowledge. The group sent to my state are right down the road, and... they look human, there isn't anything that gives them away as a robot, except with the knowledge that I have now. it's crazy, and it makes me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 37</a><div class="page-content">feel... uncomfortable. I talked to my wife about it, and she said I was just overreacting, that they didn't seem to mean any harm. After awhile, she told me I was just being overly cautious and I agreed with her. I ought to give them a chance, I mean</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 37</a><div class="page-content">what's the worst that they could do?</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It's been a few days, and things don't seem all that different. I notice them here and there, but what makes me feel weird is that  they keep... looking at me. It sends a chill down my spine every time I catch them. After I see them, they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 37</a><div class="page-content">slowly look away as if they don't care that they've been caught. It's like they... want me to know. I've tried to ignore it, but it's happening every day. I eventually broke and told my wife, screaming and losing my cool for a bit. She tried to calm me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 37</a><div class="page-content">down, but I just broke and started crying. It was like something out of a nightmare, and I couldn't wake up. Their eyes looking into my soul, their faces calm, cool and collected while mine was aghast with fear. Eventually, I was on the floor and crying,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 37</a><div class="page-content">my wife comforting me and rubbing my back. She told me everything was okay, that it was all in my head. I calmed down and she told me to go take a shower to calm down. Maybe she was right, maybe I was just overthinking this. I gave her a kiss and went up,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 37</a><div class="page-content">and took the nicest shower of my life. I felt all the fear wash off as her words rang in my ears. I just needed to calm down, maybe it is all in my head. Who knows? Maybe they're heads are just on a timer for turning and I just happen to look at them the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 37</a><div class="page-content">same time they look at me. I don't know how they work.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I just need to calm down.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The past few days, I haven't noticed any of the robots staring at me anymore. It was all in my head, just like my wife had said. I was wrong, and she was right, just like she always was. My days have been great honestly, my job has</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 37</a><div class="page-content">been peaceful, not too much paperwork to do, my wife has been supportive as ever and even the dog hasn't peed on the carpet in awhile. Things seem to be going up, and it's great, I couldn't be happier.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We got a new worker at my job today, and it turned out to be one of the robots. He definitely seemed quiet at first, but he opened up slowly as we introduced outselves around the office. He seems like a nice... fellow, but he's very</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 37</a><div class="page-content">analytical, always looking everywhere around him. Like he's trying to figure something out. Maybe it's just something in his programming, something to try and give him a personality. either way, he does have a way with words, really good at explaining</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 37</a><div class="page-content">things, I think he'll do great.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>My boss came to my office today, wanted me to take a trip for the company with the robot, as I was one of the "better" representatives of all the workers. He told me to think about it and i've been mulling it over all day. I told my wife</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 37</a><div class="page-content">about it, and she told me it was a great opportunity, and I should take it. She said it could even lead to a promotion. She was right, it was a great opportunity, I just needed to stop being so afraid. She's always right.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Tomorrow's the big day. I leave on a flight to Hawaii for the three-day business meetings with John, the robot. My wife helped me pack and i'm ready, but im nervous at the same time. My wife reassures me, which helps to make it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 37</a><div class="page-content">bearable. Still, going on a trip with a robot i've barely known a week. It should be interesting. My boss said to just let him do the talking, and only answer questions that are asked to me. It seems easy enough, and I get a week in Hawaii, so I can't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 37</a><div class="page-content">complain. I only wish my wife could come with me, she would love it.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It's been a day, and man John really knows what he's talking about. He talks like he's been in the company for years, to the point that even I wonder if he's worked that long. It's crazy, and I haven't had any questions</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 37</a><div class="page-content">asked my way, for obvious reasons. It's been relaxing, and I get to drink a margarita every afternoon by the beach. I love my job, I love my life, nothing could be any better.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Something feels... off, about John. He's been a lot more assertive recently, not letting me even say a word to the other people at the meetings, and if I try he just interrupts me, giving me a look that sends a chill down my spine.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 37</a><div class="page-content">I've become afraid to ask anything, or to even be in the same room as him. Why is he acting like this? My wife said there shouldn't be anything to worry about, that there's nothing to fear.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She's always right... right?</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This isnt right. Last night when I went to bed, he came into my room and just looked at me, and sternly told me not to say anything at the next meeting, or I would regret it. Shouldn't that be against his programming or something?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Shouldn't they have some sort of code against attacking humans? It's horrifying, and I don't know what to do. All I know is that I can't say anything, or i'll regret it.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Oh no, no no no no.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This isn't good, John, the robot... He told them to sell him the company, and all of them agreed. I wanted to say something, but every time I thought about it, I just remembered his words, and I couldn't say anything.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 37</a><div class="page-content">With the shake of hands, the robot now owned the company, and all he had was a small smile on his face, and he made eye contact with me, and nodded. I just sat quiet, unsure of what to do.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>All I know is I stayed quiet, and I wouldn't regret it.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I can't sleep comfortably anymore. My old boss was fired, and John took over without a word from anyone. It was like they all wanted him to be in charge, and everyone wanted our old boss gone. It doesn't make sense</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 37</a><div class="page-content">I tried to talk to my wife about it, but every time I tried to talk to her about it, she would change the topic, and we would get onto a whole other conversation, and I forgot what my original question was.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was then that I heard that sound in the kitchen, and the only person there was my wife.</div></div>
