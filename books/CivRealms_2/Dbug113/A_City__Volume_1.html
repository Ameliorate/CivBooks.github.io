Then i spawned in Moloka, and met Boywar3. Boywar was a farmer at the time, and he helped me greatly.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

There i had my first encounter with Medici, one of Savaguard's Jesters. Little did i know at the time,</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>

After leaving Savaguard, i went into Unitas, looking for somewhere to settle down. I found an abandoned house, which now sits directly across from Dbugingrad's town hall. I thought the house was nice.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">It had an unfinished factory, and a cozy, utilitarian design. I decided that this would be my home. I worked day and night to rebuild the house, it had obviously been griefed in the past. I do not know the previous owner, but i hope he would be proud.</div></div>

I began to feel like something was missing, that i could do something better. Therefore, i began to build another house, a perfect copy of the original. Then another,</div></div>

Yet, there were no citizens. I did not know that anyone was even in the area, let alone a nation. So i began recruitng, sending my message far and wide across !.</div></div>

I admit, we were wrong to settle that land without figuring out who owned it. Not much we can do about that now though. After a short negotiation, Dbugingrad became an Acceleradan city.
