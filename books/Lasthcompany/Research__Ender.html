The Understandings of Ender.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Appearances
-----
Ender are a peculiar race of Homonid (Homo Finis, "End Man"), which are around 3 Stone high, 1.5 Stone wide, and are Ink Black in colour.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Ender are found within the Overrealm. Their eyes are Nether Portal Violet. 

Caution is advised when viewing their eyes, for they can only safely be seen while wearing a Pumpkin.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Ender are usually neutral and will only attack when aggravated, or when looked at in the eyes. When killed, an Ender drops a large, blue-green pearl.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Ender can teleport short distances instantaneously, and exhume Portal particles.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">History
-----
Ender have been with the Overrealm since Evolution Era Designation "BETA" 1.8, but true origins are very sketchy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Some proof points to the disinergrated Far Lands, while others point to a mysterious floating dimension outside human reach.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Other folk tales speak of green eyes, and the ability to displace Adminium. Current Ender subjects are not seen to have either abilities.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Behaviours
-----
Ender are very docile, and susceptible to move small blocks such as grassed and empty surface, clay, sand and gravel.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">They have been also seen to carry dandelions, roses, and both kinds of small mushroom, cacti, pumpkins, and melons. 

In very rare cases, Ender have been seen to carry TNT. It happens mainly within armories.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Speaking with Mobologists, focusing on Ender, they have agreed that the Ender have shown some, if small, levels of creativity, and wish to become
part of the system of Mankind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Water is the Ender's weakness, and stray away from it as much as possible. 
When it rains, Ender have been seen to teleport everywhere until they either reach a rain-proof area, or die.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Pearls and Ichor
-----
When slain, Ender bodies have been seen to dissolve into Ichor, as typical of all mobs. They also drop a bluish-green pearl, dubbed by many as "Ender Pearls".
Ender Pearls have the ability of teleporting humans when thrown.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">The experience is not for the faint-hearted, however, due to side-effects with physical health, and quick and sharp pain within the legs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Eyes of Ender
-----
If combined with crushed Blaze Rod, Ender Pearls become an entirely new substance, dubbed "Eyes of Ender".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 20</a><div class="page-content">The "eyes" are as hard as Adminium, possibly harder, but are only destroyed if deployed into the air. 

When deployed, the eyes float upwards, fifteen stone away from the position it was thrown.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Wherever it is being thrown, it always leads to a nearby area, with possibly a Stronghold. 

Ancient texts believe that it leads to a more ancient realm, steeped in darkness.</div></div>
