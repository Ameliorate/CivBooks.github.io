It was the first time I had played Civcraft. I opened up my copy of Minecraft, navigated to the "Add Server" section in multiplayer, typed in "untamedears.com" as the IP, moved my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 35</a><div class="page-content">mouse tentatively to the name and hesitad for a fraction of a second before typing in "Civcraft".
Civcraft. What a name. It was only a few minutes before that I had stumbled upon a curious subreddit by hitting the random button, called /r/civcraft: Build</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 35</a><div class="page-content">with more than just blocks. I was a pretty avid Minecraft player myself, and I was curiously intrigued by the motto and the IP address lying in the sidebar, beckoning me to join, almost.
At first, I was hesitant. I didn't enjoy all of the other massive</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 35</a><div class="page-content">multiplayer servers I had tried in the past, most operators enjoyed constraining the players and demanding donations. Often I felt more like I was in a massive, low-visibility holding cell where I would die almost immediately. Yet, for reasons I still</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 35</a><div class="page-content">don't quite understand, I decided to try this one out.
As soon as I hit connect, the welcome "loading world" string popped up on the muddy background, the screen refreshed, and I was plopped down somewhere. In the immediacy of the spawning, I could only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 35</a><div class="page-content">gather that I was in some kind of dark, muddy bog. Rays of tepid light from the moon shone through the leaves of a tree into the otherwise pitch-black forest floor. On the lower left-corner of my screen, a yellow message appeared: "You wake up in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 35</a><div class="page-content">strange place".
I turned around and eyed my surroundings, squinting and trying to make sense of what was around me. I was obviously in a bog or swamp biome, a new biome added in the 1.2.5 update. I also saw, in the distance, the glint of a skeleton</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 35</a><div class="page-content">disappearing between the trees. Gathering myself, I understood I had to move out as soon as possible.
I started trotting, semi-blindly. I didn't know what direction I was going in, it didn't matter. I needed to get to some kind of lighted area. It was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 35</a><div class="page-content">strange, I thought, that the forest I found myself in was so preistine and untouched, but I thought it must be protected by the administrator as a "no-build" area and that the spawn was nearby.
I was also perplexed by the lack of chat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 35</a><div class="page-content">spam. No one was talking in the text box, no messages asking for donations were popping up, no "read the rules" in a multi-coloured bold font, was appearing. I felt almost as if I was in singleplayer, and for a moment, shivered at how <span class="fmta"></span><span class="fmto">alone </span>I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 35</a><div class="page-content">felt.
Maybe I had caught the server during a low-traffic time? I pondered this possibility and decided to set aside this reality for the moment and instead focus on survival.
I had arrived at the bottom of a large, sudden hill. Stretching</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 35</a><div class="page-content">far up into the sky, I could see the faintest hint of light, and I decided at once to climb the mountain and get to what I was sure was the spawn. "That's where there must be food kits, and instructions, and a warp zone to a build area, rife with food and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 35</a><div class="page-content">other players", I thought, not understanding why it wasn't marked better in the world. It doesn't matter, I thought excitedly, salvation is here. I marvelled, looking up at the faraway summit of the mountain for a few more seconds, until the clank of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 35</a><div class="page-content">bones and hissing coming from the dark forest reminded me I needed to start my climb.
Dauntingly I jumped from ledge to ledge, until I reached the halfway point of the mountain, and turned around to face the forest from where I had come from. My</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 35</a><div class="page-content">view stretched far out into the night turning into the early dawn as the first hints of the sun whispered in from the East. I saw the floor of the valley crawling with mobs, miniscule from the ledge. I noticed my hunger bar was already depleting from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 35</a><div class="page-content">effort of climbing such a mountain and I turned back around, determined to reach the summit before the sun broke fully.
I finally clambered up onto the top plateau, hungry and dishevelled, as the first rays of the majestic sun pierced the foggy dusk and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 35</a><div class="page-content">projected themselves forwards, past me, illuminating the structure that rested upon the mountaintop. Finally achieving a foothold on the top, a blocky rectangular cloud passed lazily above me, letting me know I was far above sea level. I eagerly made my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 35</a><div class="page-content">way towards the small wooden fort-like structure.
As I approached, however, my eagerness turned to dismay. This was no massive server spawn. I walked up to the front of the structure and a sign was planted atop the door, informing me that it's name was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 35</a><div class="page-content">"Fort Saucy" and that it was abandoned. One measly torch rested beside the door. I hit the wooden door and stepped inside.
In the interior was a dark room with a cobblestone floor and wooden walls. A crafting table and a furnace sat in one corner, and in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 35</a><div class="page-content">the other was a chest and a bed. I made my way to the chest and opened it, hoping for food, but inside was only some junk: A daisy, some seeds, and a slightly used shovel. Disappointed, I took the shovel and closed the chest.
I noticed, in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 35</a><div class="page-content">semi-obscurity, a ladder leading up to the roof of the small fort. I climbed up and through a small trapdoor fashioned in the roof and lifted myself up onto a rickety wooden roof. Marvelling at the early-morning scenery, I paused for a second and watched</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 35</a><div class="page-content">the mobs in the valley below take fire and eventually disappear in a poof of smoke. However, a quick glance to my now low hunger meter told me I needed to get a move on. I knew I had to find food soon, or face the inevitable death, and behind a death in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 35</a><div class="page-content">this server I didn't know what there was. Permanent death? Penalties? A ban? I didn't want to know. I wasn't ready to know. Not yet, I had just started.
I quickly made my way back into the room downstairs and checked the furnace. To my bewilderment</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 35</a><div class="page-content">there was a pile of sticks in the bottom and a piece of bread in the top! I didn't know how long the bread had been sitting there, or if the server had custom plugins to simulate food decay, but I decided I needed to take my chances, and quickly wolfed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 35</a><div class="page-content">the bread down. With relief I saw that it had restored a few points of hunger.
I was suddenly made aware of movement outside my house. I turned around from the furnace and heard a stumbling of legs on grass. What could this be? Maybe a pig, or a cow, or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 35</a><div class="page-content">some other peaceful mob come to deliver to me it's loot, or maybe a lone creeper, survivor of the genocide that comes each Minecraft morning? I knew not, but a sudden flash of nametag informed me that I might have been in the presence of some company.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 35</a><div class="page-content">I slowly made my way to the door and peeked out. I nearly jumped in my chair when I saw a posse of diamond-armour wearing players, all with their swords drawn. One of them was pointing a bow at me. I made a move to back into my house and close the door,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 35</a><div class="page-content">and the arrow was shot, slicing off half of my health as it stabbed me through the shoulder.
I mashed my chat button and quickly wrote, in all caps, "HELP! I'M BEING ATTACKED!". The rest was a flurry of activity as I ran back into the room and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 35</a><div class="page-content">clambered up the ladder, attempting to get to the roof. I had tunnel vision as I concentrated on getting up to the roof and escaping my attackers. I punched in every direction as I was surrounded, yelling, screaming, and attempting to escape.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 35</a><div class="page-content">I stopped for a second and looked at the chat. It was besieged by messages of the different players of the group asking me to calm down. I was given apples and cooked chickens, and an iron chestplate was handed to me by the posse. They explained to me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 35</a><div class="page-content">that they were simply patrolling the area, their area, they told me proudly, and had seen a mysterious unknown player disappear into a building from far away. Then they revealed they were Spaniards, and, in their own language, we exchanged laughs</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 35</a><div class="page-content">and apologies. I told them I had just joined, and with enthusiasm in their voices they told me they had a lot to show me.
And it was as such, taken under the wing of this group, that my first day on Civcraft ended, and I knew from that moment on that the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 35</a><div class="page-content">hook of Civcraft had caught flesh and that I was there to stay.</div></div>
