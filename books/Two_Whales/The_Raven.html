<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 29</a><div class="page-content">forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 29</a><div class="page-content">
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
`'Tis some visitor entreating</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 29</a><div class="page-content">entrance at my chamber door -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
This it is, and nothing more,'
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 29</a><div class="page-content">forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -</div></div>

But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 29</a><div class="page-content">token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'
Merely this and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 29</a><div class="page-content">flown before -
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 29</a><div class="page-content">still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 29</a><div class="page-content">he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 29</a><div class="page-content">ominous bird of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now</div></div>

Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot</div></div>

`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!

Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as `Nevermore.'
But the raven,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 29</a><div class="page-content">sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have</div></div>

This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,</div></div>

Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of "Never-nevermore</div></div>

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this</div></div>
