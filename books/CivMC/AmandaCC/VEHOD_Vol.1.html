After that, I logged off for the day. I am writing the day this has happened, on June 5th 2022. I will continue this text on other days with anything relevant.

While we advanced on our building, notably having built a very small bunker and a storage room as well as a few factories, the next few days were marred with claim conflicts. 
On the fifth, members of a nation called The Collective approached</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 98</a><div class="page-content">us to pre-empt any claim conflict as they had run into us in a jungle just south of our main town. We made a The Collective diplomacy channel and the short discussion that ensued ended with the conclusion that no conflict was present. 
However, two days later, The Collective</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 98</a><div class="page-content">announced revised claims that included the small jungle area in which we had a small farm and planned to expand it. We tried to ping them about it in the aforementioned channel but no response was given until we had discovered that Cortesia Del Mar had bought the jungle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 98</a><div class="page-content">area from The Collective (or so it seems, the situation is ongoing as I write). This caused a bit of a stir. A first groupchat was created between the Mery and representatives of Cortesia Del Mar in which we discussed the issue.
The representatives (namely one who was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 98</a><div class="page-content">most active, Hyper_Warrior) argued that we had not gone through the “proper channels”, which they claimed to be “making a reddit post”, and when I suggested that they claim another bit of jungle land they said that this is a claim issue and that it must be resolved. It must</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 98</a><div class="page-content">stressed that I am not suggesting any ill-intentioned behavior on the part of Cortesia Del Mar, just that it seems that they have a developed sense of legalism and/or formality, and I can see how it must be slightly dissonant for them to interact with a nation that attempts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 98</a><div class="page-content">to make no specific and precise territorial claims. Nevertheless, another groupchat with members from CdM, The Collective, The Mery (myself and smal) and Lambat, as visibly they were also involved in the jungle purchase.
I write as the situation is in developpement,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 98</a><div class="page-content">and will update further soon; as it stands now, the diplomat Hyper_Warrior has posted a long message in the second groupchat recapping the situation and advocating for co-ownership of the jungle.
Here is the message:</div></div>

Okay let me write up a summary as I think I have good knowledge of the situation now: - Yesterday, us @IceCarim (CDM), TC and Lambat created an agreement to divy up the land around the jungle. Please see the next image for what our agreement would be.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 98</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Now, we have discovered that @Smal @DetectiveCC (TM) claim the jungle at the north of what TC claim and the area west of what Lambat claim. This includes our island claim. We are willing to sacrifice the island in return for part-ownership of the jungle at the north tip of what TC and TM</div></div>

However, we understand that our want is subordinate to the wants of you three who are active in the region. We would love the idea of co-ownership of some form. 
TM claim that you @kaprediem (Lambat) have agreed with them that the land to the west should be theirs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 98</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Essentially, (if I am correct), they believe that there should be no dispute between you (Lambat) and TM. The reason I add you to this group is because I want to make sure sure that the Lambat x TM issue is resolved.
Furthermore, I add you @Korvenov @Evidence based only</div></div>

After I pointed out that the agreement did not seemingly portray CdM acquiring ownership, they said I was correct, and informed me of the sequence of events: first, they acquired an island (which we also wish to build on but is not very relevant) that they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 98</a><div class="page-content">thought was a jungle-island, secondly, they realized it was not, thirdly, they reopened communication with the Collective to acquire a piece of jungle from their territory, fourthly, they realized we had a claim to it. (This would imply the Collective was purposefully</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 98</a><div class="page-content"> ignoring our pings in our diplomacy channel and knew we had a previous claim to their territory, but I do not know enough about how everything was found out to say for certain).

I do not know what outcome these talks will have, but I am inclined to share the jungle as it is the Mery spirit, and the representatives have been kind. As of</div></div>

After long hours of talking in our diplomacy channel in our discord, the Collective has ceded the jungle. I do not know why it took so long, since most of their claim is of the jungle biome, and our jungle claim is very small. Hilariously, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 98</a><div class="page-content">discussions in our Collective diplomacy channel included the Collective trying to sell us back our land, an offer for us to integrate into their nation, and of course being confused about us not having posted a “proper” claim on reddit.

During the talks with the Collective, Val Tawiga was very aggressive and rude.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 98</a><div class="page-content"> I apologized for this when their leader arrived in the group chat and asked Val Tawiga privately to chill out.

The talks ended, semi-anticlimactically and quickly, by CdM announcing they had negotiated control of a closer bit of jungle biome, and so they no longer needed our jungle area, but said they looked forward to collaborating with</div></div>
