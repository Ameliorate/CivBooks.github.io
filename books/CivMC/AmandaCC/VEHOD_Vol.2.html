Dehs Tawiga proposed the Lighthouse Accord two days before I write this, so on the 6th of July, however, it was hotly debated, especially by one “wingnut4096”, who I think is the leader of the Church of Ranubis, on the grounds that it was</div></div>

Shortly after, or before, I’m not sure, Dehs Tawiga removed her proposal on r/danzilona. I assume they are still debating it in discord, as Pithiyus Tawiga has just sent us a draft of a revised version which is essentially

After some consideration, I have decided to end this book here. I believe in documenting history, but if I wrote any more it wouldn’t really be a “very early” history of the Mery, it's barely even "early
