<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Laconia was originally founded by Yoahtlan expats and quickly grew to become an independent state in prior iterations of the civ genre. In this particular iteration, Yoahtl founded the city of Axochitlan</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Despite these concerning developments, morale in Yoahtl was very high at this point - the lack of an organized defense by Laconia emboldened the population, and a Yoahtlan declaration</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>On December 4th, Amerikkalainen, now operating as Yoahtlan general, led another expedition to Mt. Doom with a team composed</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>After about a week of infighting and debate on how best to move forward, Yoahtl's hand was forced - it had come to light that Lexington had considered using the conflict as a justification to invade and raze Yoahtl, risking Yoahtl's entry</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">into the Somber War. The old fears that had kept Yoahtl from reigniting the Laconia conflict in the first place rose to the surface once again, and after deliberation the decision was made to negotiate the end of the conflict. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Massive reparations were</div></div>
