<span class="fmt0">  By the time they reached Indiana, Bill realized that Ruthie, his driving companion, was incapable of theoretical debate. She drove okay, she went halves on gas, etc., but she refused<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>

Bill was used to East Coast women who disputed everything he said, every step of the way. Ruthie stuck to simple observation, like "look, cows." He choked it up to the fact she was from rural Ohio and thrilled to death<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
