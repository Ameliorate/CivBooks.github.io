<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  [NOTE - This is not a fancy sketch. I got it from a clergyman who was an instructor at Woolwich forty years ago, and who vouched for its truth.]<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  It was a banquet in London in honour of one of the two or three conspicuously</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Illustrious English military names of this generation. For reasons which will presently appear, I will withhold his real name and titles, and call him Lieutenant General Lord Arthur Scoresby, V.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a fascination there is in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 39</a><div class="page-content">renowned name! There sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard of so many thousands of times since that day, thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly to the zenith from a Crimean battlefield, to remain forever celebrated. It was food and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 39</a><div class="page-content">drink for me to look, and look, and look at that demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his countenance; the simple honesty that expressed itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness of his greatness -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 39</a><div class="page-content">unconsciousness of the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving, sincere worship welling out of the breats of those people and flowing toward him.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">    The clergyman at my left was an old aquaintance of mine -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 39</a><div class="page-content">clergyman now, but had spent the first half of his life in the camp and field, and as an instructor in the military school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I have been talking about, a vieled and singular light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned down and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 39</a><div class="page-content">muttered confidentially to me - indicating the hero of the banquet with a gesture:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   "Privately - He's an absolute fool."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">  This verdict was a great surprise to me. If subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or Solomon, my astonishment could not have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 39</a><div class="page-content">been greater. Two things I was well aware of: that the reverand was a man of strict veracity, and that his judgement of men was good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or question, that the world was mistaken about this hero: he <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">was<span class="fmt0"> a fool. So I meant to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 39</a><div class="page-content">find out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend, all solitary and alone, had discovered the secret.  <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  Some days later the Opportunity came, and this is what the Reverend told me. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">    About 40 years ago I was an instructor in the military</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 39</a><div class="page-content">acadamy at Woolwich. I was present in one of the sections when young Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination. I was touched to the quick with pity; for the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely, while he - why, dear me, he didn't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 39</a><div class="page-content">know <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">anything, <span class="fmt0">so to speak. He was evidently good and sweet, and loveable, and guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to see him stand there, as serene as a graven image, and deliver himself of answers which were veritably miraculous for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 39</a><div class="page-content">stupidity and ignorance. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when he comes to be examined again he will be flung over, of course; so it will be simply a harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much as I can. I took</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 39</a><div class="page-content">him aside, and found that he knew a little of Caesar's history; and as he didn't know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a gallery slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning Caesar which I knew would be used. If you'll believe</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 39</a><div class="page-content">me, he went throught with flying colours on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial "cram," and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. By some strangely lucky accident - an accident not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 39</a><div class="page-content">likely to happen twice in a century - he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of the drill.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   It was Stupefying. Well, all through his course I stood by him, with something of the sentiment which a mother feels for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 39</a><div class="page-content">a crippled child; and he always saved himself - just by a miracle apparently.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  Now of course the thing that would expose him and kill him at last was mathematics. I resolved to make his death as easy as I could; so I drilled him and crammed him,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 39</a><div class="page-content">and crammed him and drilled him, just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launching him to his fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  Sleep? There was no more sleep for me for a week. My conscience tortured me day and night. What I had done I had done purely through charity, and only to ease the poor youth's fall - I had never dreamed of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">any such preposterous result as the thing that had happened. I felt as guilty and miserable as the creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead whom I had put in the way of glittering promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and but one thing could</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 39</a><div class="page-content">happen: he and his responsibilities would all go to ruin together at the first opportunity.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">  The Crimean war had just broken out. Of course there had to be war, I said to myself: we couldn't have peace and give this donkey a chance to die before he is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 39</a><div class="page-content">found out. I waited for the earthquake. It came. And it made me reel when it did come. He was actually gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment! Better men grow old and grey before they climb to a sublimity like that. And who could ever have forseen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 39</a><div class="page-content">that they would go and put such a load of responsibility on such a green and inadequate shoulders? I could just barely have stood it if they had made him a cornet; but a captain - think of it! I thought my hair would turn white.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Consider what I did</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 39</a><div class="page-content"> - I who so loved repose and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible to the country for this, and I must go along with him and protect the country against him as far as I can. So I took my poor little capital that I had saved up  through years of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 39</a><div class="page-content">work and grinding economy, and went with a sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment, and away with me to the field.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  And there - oh dear, it was awful. Blunders? Why he never did anything <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">but <span class="fmt0">blunder. But, you see, nobody was in the fellow's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 39</a><div class="page-content">secret - everybody had him focused wrong, and necessarily misinterpreted his performance everytime - consequently they took his idiotic blunders for inspirations of genius; they did honestly! His mildest blunders were enough to make a man in his right</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 39</a><div class="page-content">mind cry; and they did make me cry - and rage and rave too, privately. And the thing that kept me always in a sweat of apprehension was the fact every fresh blunder he made increased the lustre of his reputation! I kept saying to myself, he'll get so high</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 39</a><div class="page-content">, that when the discovery does finally come, it will be like the sun falling out the sky.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"> He went right along up, from grade to grade, over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at last, in the hottest moment of the battle of [█████] down went our</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 39</a><div class="page-content">colonel, and my heart jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next in rank! Now for it, said I; we'll all land in Sheol in ten minutes, sure.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"> The battle was awfully hot; the allies were steadily giving was all over the field. Our regiment occupied a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 39</a><div class="page-content">position that was vital; a blunder now must be destruction. At this crucial moment, what does this immortal fool do but detach the regiment from its plave and order a charge over a neighbouring hill where there wasn't a suggestion of an enemy! "There you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 39</a><div class="page-content">go!" I said to myself; "this IS the end at last."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  And away we did go, and were over the shoulder of the hill before the insane movement could be discovered and stopped. And what did we find? An entire and unsuspected Russian army in reserve! and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 39</a><div class="page-content">what happened? We were eaten up? That is necessarily what would have happened in 99 cases out of a hundred. But no, those Russians argued that no single regiment would come browsing around here at such time. It must be the entire English army, and that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 39</a><div class="page-content">the sly Russian game was detected and blocked; so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell, over the hill and down into the field, in wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves broke the solid Russian centre in the field, and tore through,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 39</a><div class="page-content">and in no time there was the most tremendous rout you ever saw, and the defeat of the allies was turned into a sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration, and delight; and sent off for Scorseby, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 39</a><div class="page-content">hugged him, and decorated him on the field, in the presence of all the armies!<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"> And what was Scoresby's blunder that time? Merely the mistaking his right hand for his left - that was all. An order had come to him to fall back and support our right; and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 39</a><div class="page-content">instead, he fell forward and went over the hill to the left. But the name he won that day as a marvellous military genius filled the world with his glory, and that glory will never fade while history books last.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">  He is just as good and sweet and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 39</a><div class="page-content">loveable and unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn't know enough to come in when it rains. Now that is absolutely true. He is the supremest ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago nobody knew it but himself and me. He has been pursued, day by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 39</a><div class="page-content">day and year by year, by a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness. He has been a shining soldier in all our wars for a generation; he has littered his whole military life with blunders, and yet has never committed one that didn't make him a knight or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 39</a><div class="page-content">a baronet or a lord or something. Look at his breast; why, he is just a clothed in domestic and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one of them is the record of some shouting stupidity or other; and taken together, they are proof that the very best</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 39</a><div class="page-content">thing in all this world that can befall a man is to be born lucky. I say again, as I said at the banquet, Scoresby's an absolute fool.</div></div>
