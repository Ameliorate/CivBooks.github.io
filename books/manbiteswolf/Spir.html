<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The Spiral Confederacy's claim spans roughly 2700m x 1500m. It is extremely sparsely built-in. I personally walked every meter of the claim over the course of the last week and encountered only one other player, someone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">from Clearwater who owns a section in the middle of the S.C. claim. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Having walked the entire claim, dug around markers, tried to break walls and enter locked doors, I can say that I would have triggered any and every snitch that they would've had, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">absolutely would have drawn attention to <span class="fmt0">myself....but<span class="fmt0"> I got nothing. No words of warning, no attacks. <span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">This fact, along with the lack of buildings in the claim, brings me to one of a few conclusions:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">1) The S.C. reside mostly underground, in one of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">dozens of naturally occuring caves/holes that sprinkle their lands<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">2) The S.C. are very inactive players in general and simply have not been on, none of them, for the last week<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">3) They are so extremely cautious that not only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">do they live below ground, but they do not even respond to intruders. I even grew wheat on some of the farms I found and came back later to harvest it. Nothing.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Every farm/village I found was long abandoned and devoid of villagers except for one, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">that village was so forgotten there were villagers trapped in holes caused by creepers. Every tunnel/hole that I found that appeared to be manmade, I explored. None had been explored deeper than a few dozen meters. I found evidence of only two mines, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">both were incomplete, empty, and abandoned. The entire claim is either just being built, or in some stage of abandonment.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The only exceptions are places that I have taken note of, one at the north of the claim (-2159, 2157) and at the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">south end of the claim (-1940, 3230). These were the only buildings that were locked and had their walls reinforced, but again over the whole week I saw nobody and was never warned or even spoken to despite the fact I tried to break into both places just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">to draw them out. They either weren't around, didn't even have snitches set up, or were unable/unwilling to confront me for some reason. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Geography<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Geographically speaking, this is a very diverse claim area.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">There are high mountains that border the easternmost edge. The middle is endless plains and hills dotted with natural caverns. The claim is split by four large rivers that all converge within the Clearwater section in the middle. To the west there is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">desert filled with maze-like caverns. The claim is rife with areas that would make excellent bases/outposts that would be easily <span class="fmt0">defendable...but<span class="fmt0"> there is nothing. <span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">If we were to move against the S.C.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">we would be going into a large, sparsely built up claim that very well could hide bases under the ground. I found many caves and crevasses but it would take literal months to explore them all. We would be best served by simply focusing on the two points</div></div>
