I dangerously took the Nether roads to get to my destination quickly. No danger came to me, as i arrived in the city intact. My first glance at the city immediately brought me to awe. Large towers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">marked my entrance. I was only a few steps into the city when I hear a raspy voice echo over the chat. "Who are you" The voice said. Me starteled that anyone was still in the city immediately dove into an alley. From behind cover I glanced in all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">directions to see where the voice came from. Responding the obvious "I'm Seldomshock" "Why are you here stranger" I heard as a response. I immediately gave all of my basic info about my mission. From behind some rubble of buildings emerged a man. We</div></div>

Startled I raised my sword in defense. My new friend quickly telling me to stand down explained the situation. He and his resistance crew were headed to an HCF boat to raid</div></div>

Me with a young heart full of adventure decided a slight side-track was just what I needed.

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">a simpler time. Now this city was part of the war zone. THe resistance fought with the savage HCF at every turn. Fighting for their city. This posed a question to me. If my home town were attacked would I put everything on the line to save it?</div></div>

Enough swiftness potions to make even Gordge drunk, and the gold stacks upon stacks. We piled it on deck handing it out equally. Everyone besides Lazer, me, and a few others were left</div></div>
