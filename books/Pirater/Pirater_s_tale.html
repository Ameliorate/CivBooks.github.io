<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 3</a><div class="page-content">Once upon a time, there was a ship which elegantly hovered over the crystal-clear ocean waves. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The sea had thrown everything against the ship, but despite this, it had survived.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">This was about to change.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 3</a><div class="page-content">A menacing, blue squid with the name of "TTK2" emerged from the clouded waters - barnacled and aggressive. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It took a swing at the ship, but the ship staggered backwards, and continued sailing towards its destination.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 3</a><div class="page-content">The fear on the crews faces were evident, as the squid kept doing shit that they didn't like.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Then it turned out the destination was the squids mouth, so it got eaten the whole time and died.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">THE END</div></div>
