<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Well once upon a time, in a BEAUTIFUL village there was an innocent wool coated sheep. Every morning the sheep would smile with its innocent glare at Retarden Tower. Only things would change the following evening. A storm front came, and the Tower's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">evil master Delbunk was sitting a-top his tower scheming against the poor sheep. It never harmed him in any way shape or form, and was loved by all its community. The sheep was seen as a symbol of beauty, pride, and peace. The evil Delbunk sat in his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">tower chanting into the sky cursing the white sheep house of Lazuli. Then, over the horizon the great and powerful councilor of justice NateMagic appeared. He banished the evil Delbunk's cursed tounge to silence. Only it was too late, the curse had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">already taken effect on the poor sheep. It started to burn, you could hear the sheep screaming for help. Frantically NateMagic rushed over to the sheep calming it down and patting out the fire on its poor and helpless back. NateMagic seeing that all was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">well with the sheep then turned to Delbunk. Cursing him for attempting to murder such a harmless and innocent creature. Delbunk the Evil only saw this as a challenge to his power. Delbunk thinking NateMagic the Great could easily</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">be outdone, decided he would burn the sheep while NateMagic was resting. NateMagic while on his normal patrol through out the beautiful city of Lazuli came to an empty plot. It didn't take long before he realised what had happened. He then</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">decided that something would have to be done. He looked up to the heavens and asked for the great gods of minecraft to bestow upon him the gift of reincarnation. He used this gift to restore the sheep to its former glory. Only this time the sheep</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">would come back almost a thousand times more powerful then before. The sheep rose from the ground burning all things around him still aching from the flames that had previously engulfed him. The sheep stood there, red, gray, and sad. It was sad</div></div>

It had never wronged anyone. What had happened to it was completly unjust, and evil. So the sheep saught vengeance upon Delbunk the Evil. NateMagic would protect this</div></div>

Eventually the sheep cooled down and returned to its previous white and beautiful state. Prior to that though, the sheep was a burning mass of flesh in testament to how it was killed. Every time Delbunk the evil walked by</div></div>

He could sense it was more powerful then he could have ever hoped to become. All in all Delbunk the evil eventually realised the true beauty of the sheep. Then the sheep was happy. Now Delbunk the evil,</div></div>
