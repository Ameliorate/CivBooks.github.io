The original Manor burned down along with my dog, Sir Barks. A new Saucy Manor was built on top of the ruins and that ended up being the first building of the Republic of Lazuli. 

I didn't realize at the time,</div></div>

I was set on moving off as I had done before with Fort Saucy (discussed more thouroughly in <span class="fmto">History of (+,-)</span>) but I ended up staying to meet up with my brother, Cooliocrow.

In my journal I also mention going through a ruined village. This village was located roughly near 1000, -4000. It was an NPC</div></div>

The first city I headed towards was Rift, shortly after I completed Fort Saucy. I don't know why I decided on Rift as I sure as hell didn't know whether it'd take me 1 hour or 1 week to get</div></div>

I went about 300 or so blocks to the north where I found a neat laggon nestled in between a jungle biome and the ocean.
