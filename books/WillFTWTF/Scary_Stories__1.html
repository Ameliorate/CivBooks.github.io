   You look out the sliding glass doors to your backyard, and you notice a man standing out in the snow. He fits the profile of the murderer exactly,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 41</a><div class="page-content">and he is smiling at you.
   You gulp, picking up the phone to your right and dialing 911. You look back out the glass as you press the phone to your ear, and notice he is much closer to you now.
You then drop the phone in shock.</div></div>

It's his reflection.</div></div>

    The Masterpiece



      -By WillFTWTF</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 41</a><div class="page-content">I've been lying down for hours now. It's 5:35 AM and there's not much I can do. You know what's the worst part about my situation is? I'm in the same room as my parents. They keep looking at me, and I can't help but look back and try not to cry or scream.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Their eyes are focused on me and their mouths are wide open. There's the strong scent of blood and I feel so paralyzed with fear. 
   Here's the thing. The second I make any hint that I'm not asleep anymore, I'm completely fucked. I will die and there's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 41</a><div class="page-content">nobody around to save me. I've been trying to think of a way out but the only idea I have is to rush for the door and run outside the front door and scream for help, hoping any neighbors hear me. It's risky, but if I stay here, I'll surely die.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 41</a><div class="page-content">He's waiting for me to wake up and see his masterpiece.
   You're probably wondering what's going on. I do get ahead of myself sometimes.
   About three hours ago, I heard screaming from the other side of the house. I got up and went to check on the noise</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 41</a><div class="page-content">before realizing I had to use the restroom. Instead of doing the smart thing and investigating, I used the bathroom first. I could've gotten myself killed right then from my stupid actions. But I actually did my business and took a peek outside the room.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 41</a><div class="page-content">There was blood on the carpet. I got very worried and ran back to my room, hiding under my sheets like the pussy I was. I tried to convince myself to go back to sleep, that it was just some really vivid dream or something.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 41</a><div class="page-content">   But I heard my bedroom door open. Like the terrified child I was, I peeked from under my blankets to see what was going on. I could see something dragging my dead parents into the room. It was not human, I can tell you that.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 41</a><div class="page-content">It was hairless, with no eyes and no clothing. It walked like a caveman, with its back slouched as it dragged my parents. But this thing was much smarter than any caveman. It was aware of what it was doing.
   It propped my dad up on the edge of the bed,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 41</a><div class="page-content">and made him face me. It then sat my mother down in the chair and positioned her towards me as well. It then started rubbing its hands upon the walls, Staining them with blood and then drew a circle with the devil's pentagram in it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 41</a><div class="page-content">This thing had made what it would probably call a masterpiece. To finish it off, it scribbled a message on the wall that I could not read in the darkness. 
   It then positioned itself under my bed, waiting to strike.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 41</a><div class="page-content">   The scariest thing is now, my eyes have adjusted to the darkness since then and I can read the message on the wall. I don't want to look at it, because it's terrifying to think about. But I feel the need to see, before I'm killed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 41</a><div class="page-content">
I peek at the creature's masterpiece.

      The Message

      -By WillFTWTF</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 41</a><div class="page-content">   Don't dismiss this outright as the work of some raving lunatic. There's some sense to this story, if you'll just hear me out...

   Look, we all wonder if time travel is possible, right? Well, let me tell you something... it is. I'm from the future,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 41</a><div class="page-content">actually. I know you probably don't believe that, but seriously, I'm from the future. It's a really great thing; getting to see the past, watching events unfold... stuff like that. We know more now than we ever would. 

   Behind all the fun, though,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 41</a><div class="page-content">there's a more serious aspect. We aren't supposed to go in our own lifetime, and we are NEVER allowed to contact our past selves. Let me tell you, I'm breaking that rule right now. Yes, kid, you're talking to yourself. Your future self. I'm going to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 41</a><div class="page-content">executed for saying this, but you know what? I accept that. I'm preventing something by talking to you that is WORSE than death. I can't tell you outright what to do, because the filters would catch it. This is the closest I can get, trust me. I can,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 41</a><div class="page-content">however, send a little message.

   You should probably read the first word of every paragraph, now.</div></div>

     Psychic Ability
   
     -by WillFTWTF</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 41</a><div class="page-content">I live in Osaka, Japan and often use the subway to go to work in the morning. One day, when I was waiting for the train, I noticed a homeless man standing in a corner of the subway station, muttering to himself as people passed by. He was holding out a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 41</a><div class="page-content">cup, and seemed to be begging for spare change. 

A fat woman passed by the homeless man and I distinctly heard him say, "Pig." 

Wow, I thought to myself. This homeless man is insulting people and he still expects</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 41</a><div class="page-content">them to give him money?

Then a tall businessman went by and the homeless guy muttered, "Human."

Human? I couldn't argue with that. Obviously, he was a human.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 41</a><div class="page-content">The next day, I arrived early at the subway station and had some time to kill, so I decided to stand close to the homeless man and listen to his strange mutterings.

A thin, haggard-looking man passed in front of him and I heard the homeless guy mutter,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Cow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Potato? I was under the impression that he called all fat people "Pig."

That day, at work, I couldn't stop thinking about the homeless man and his puzzling behavior. I kept trying to find some logic or pattern in what he was muttering.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps he has some kind of psychic ability, I thought. Maybe he knows what these people were in a previous life. In Japan, many people believe in reincarnation. 

I observed the homeless man many times and began to think my theory was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 41</a><div class="page-content">right. I often heard him calling people things like "Rabbit" or "Onion" or "Sheep" or "Tomato".

One day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask him what was going on.

As I walked up to him, he looked at me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 41</a><div class="page-content">and said, "Bread."

I tossed some money into his cup and asked him if he had some kind of psychic ability. 

The homeless man smiled and said, "yes, indeed. I do have a psychic abillity. It is an ability I obtained years ago.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 41</a><div class="page-content">But it is not what you might expect. I can't tell the future or read minds or anything like that."

"Then what is your ability?" I asked eagerly.

"It is merely to know the last thing anyone ate," he said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 41</a><div class="page-content">I laughed because I realized he was right. He said "Bread." The last thing I had eaten for breakfast that day was toast. I walked away shaking my head. Of all the psychic abilities someone could have, that one must be the most useless.

Now read it again.</div></div>
