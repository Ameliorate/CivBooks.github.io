      OF THE MIND

  In 1983, a team of deeply pious scientists conducted a radical experiment in an undisclosed facility. The scientists had theorized that a human without access to senses or ways to percieve stimuli would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">be able to perceive the presence of God.
  They believed that the five senses clouded our awareness of eternity, and without them, a human cuold actually establish contact with God by thought, An elderly man who claimed to have "nothing left to live</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">for" was the only test subject to volunteer. To purge him of all his senses, the scientists performed a complex operation in which every sensory nerve connection to the brain was surgically severed. Althought the test subject retained full muscular</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">function, he could not see, hear, taste, smell, or feel. With no possible way to communicate with or even sense the otuside world, he was alone with his thoughts. 
  Scientists monitored him as he spoke aloud about his state of mind in jumbled, slurred</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">sentences that he couldn't even hear. After four days, the man claimed to be hearing hushed, unintelligible voices in his head. Assuming it was an onset of phychosis, the scientists paid little attention to the man's concerns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">  Two days later, the man cried that he could hear his dead wife speaking with hiim, and even more, he could communicate back. The scientists were intrigued, but were not convinced until the subject started naming dead relatives of the scientists.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">He repeated personal information to the scientists that only their dead spouses and parents would have known. At this point, a sizable portion of scientists left the study.
  After a week of conversing with the deceased through his thoughts, the subject</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">became distressed, saying the voices were overwhelming. In every waking moment, his consciousness was bombarded by hundreds of voices that refused to leave him alone. He frequently threw himself against the wall, trying to elicit a pain response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">He begged the scientists for sedatives, so he could escape the voices by sleeping. This tactic worked for three days, until he started having severe night terrors. The subject repeatedly said that he could see and hear the deceased in his dreams.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">  Only a day later, the subject began to scream and claw at his non-functional eyes, hoping to sense something in the physical world. the hysterical subject now said the voices of the dead were deafening and hostile, speaking of the end of the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">At one point, he yelled "No heaven, no forgiveness" for five hours straight. he continually begged to be killed, but the scientists were convinced that he was close to establishing contact with God.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">   After another day, the subject could no longer form coherent sentences. Seemingly mad, he started to bite off chunks of flesh from his arm. The scientists rushed into the test chamber and restrained him to a table so he could not kill himself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After a few hours of being tied down, the subject halted his struggling and screaming. he stared blankly at the ceiling as teardrops silently streaked across his face. For two weeks, the subject had to be manually rehydrated due to the constant crying.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Eventually, he turned his head and, despite his blindness, made focused eye contact with a scientist for the first time in the study. 
He whispered "I have spoken with god, and He has abandoned us."

His vital signs stopped.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">

There was no apparent cause of death.</div></div>
