<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I helped with the excavation and construction of Jack's Hold, meeting the original members Noxy, Jackalope, RKWildcard and KineticWaffle<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">(<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">probably a few others as well but I don't remember<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Jack's Hold was awesome, a huge IRO fortress in the centre, strong high walls and embassy towers all around. I first found out about Mt Augusta via their embassy tower.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I played with the Jacks for a while.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">One of my clearest memories is myself, Noxy and Wildcard protted up on a roof overlooking Kizantium's main square, trying to pacify a possible riot.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Back then, the Romans in Kizantium (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">including r3kon<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">) had an ongoing protest with Columbia, the largest and most prosperous city on 1.0.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I also recall first talking to Sami - now Saleel - about the way I was treating rogersd, the founder and sole member of the 'grefer hunters'. I apologised as I had not realised he was a young child.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 47</a><div class="page-content">After a while, the Jacks became slightly inactive and subreddit opinion swung against us, painting us as warlike barbarians. Our belief in a strong state put us at natural loggerheads with the then mainly anarcho-capitalist population of the server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I logged in one day to find griefed buildings and no one else I knew online, so I decided to leave and see what else the server held. I entered the nether and made my way to Columbia, which had recently fallen.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 47</a><div class="page-content">What had been a huge, active metropolis was now pretty much a ghost town, giant empty skyscrapers towering over silent streets.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I found a plot and began to build a small church (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">they're one of the few buildings I can design to a high standard, for some reason<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">) and put my tiny amount of wealth in a dropchest in the desert nearby.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 47</a><div class="page-content">As I was building the church, one of the few still active Columbians came along and warned me that even though no one currently owned the land,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 47</a><div class="page-content">if one of the previous owners logged back in he would be within his rights to pearl me and destroy what I had built. This pretty much ended my short stay in Columbia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 47</a><div class="page-content">While there, I had seen and explored a huge, abandoned commune called Goldmayne in the then traditional LSIF Hive-Tower style. I was intrigued but also tired of dealing with restrictive laws and inactive friends.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I was pretty burnt out at this time so I left for a few weeks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 47</a><div class="page-content">On returning, I decided to hermit for a while. I found and claimed an island and began to construct an ironic roleplay faction in homage to the DDR (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">hence my account name Erich_Honecker_.<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 47</a><div class="page-content">One day while traveling the nether roads I found a copy of People's News Today by ZombieLenin, and realised the server didn't need two zombified ex-Soviet dictators.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I stayed on my island for a while, doing typical hermit things before I got bored of the isolation and poverty inherent in such a lifestyle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Near to my island was the city of Mt Augusta - one of the oldest continuously populated cities on the server, along with Aristopolis, Panneton and Haven, and also one of the cities most open to new citizens.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I was given a plot and built a small house, and began to immerse myself in the city and its people. In Mount Augusta was the then most active LSIF commune, Ataraxia.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This was the beginning of the best time I had on 1.0. I spent the vast majority of my 1.0 playtime as a member of the LSIF.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 47</a><div class="page-content">It would take far too long to write out everything I did with them, but the short version is that they were great friends and we built cities, produced surpluses and spread our ideology as far as we could.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 47</a><div class="page-content">We had nether communes, secret hideaways and of course Panneton, the home commune. It really has to be seen to be believed - a huge beehive incorporating all kinds of farms, mob grinders, libraries, and so on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 47</a><div class="page-content">While I was a part of the LSIF, I also spent a lot of time in the CKC (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">Cool Kids Club<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">) channel on mumble. This was where a lot of the ancaps hung out, but plenty of others were also there, from all across the political spectrum.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Here I was introduced to anarcho-capitalist theories on property rights, individualism and Austrian economics. I made a few friends here, even becoming on fairly decent terms with the (<span class="fmtf">.<span class="fmt0">in)famous Foofed -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 47</a><div class="page-content">he once called me his 'favourite East German communist'. Back then, the server community was smaller and more inter- connected - You could travel to the other side of the map in 30 minutes and most everyone knew each other on some level.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">At some point we in the LSIF started to get paranoid about ancap attacks on us and we built several hidden bases, like Red Exodus. At around this time, the first HCF invasion occurred.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Mt Augusta was covered in cobble and the streets were patrolled by the HCF, pearling anyone they saw. The LSIF decided to move our main base to the +,+, then inhabited by the RSSR and the Kingdom of Prussia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">We constructed a new city, named Chiapas after the Zapatista movement in Mexico.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Chiapas was inspired by native Mayan architecure - stepped pyramids and wide processional ways were the main focal point of the commune.</div></div>
