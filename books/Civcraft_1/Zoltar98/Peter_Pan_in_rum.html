Good afternoon gents and girls.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Are you comfy, plenty of nibbles about?<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Good.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
For here is the tale of Peter Pan, a disgruntled poet<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
with his face slammed against the wall of writers block.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
His muse drowned in a swig of Cuban</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 34</a><div class="page-content">rum.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The slim possibility of the next poem at the bottom of each bottle,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
while 50s Uncle Sam screams red to McCarthy tunes.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The Neon sign of Never Never land hotel burns dead,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A kingdom of lost youth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Forever prowled by lost boys,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Forever the hunting grounds of the biker king of Hook<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Who thrusts his lust into the harlot Wendy.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
All while blood flows to the feisty groans<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Of the sociopath Crocodile.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
All these players</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">don’t know it;<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
All these gamblers of wild beats have their cards on the table.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And someone is bluffing for soon the jig is up.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Another day dawns on the Neon.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Another swig for Peter dearest<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Another bloody body for the croc,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Another hateful kiss for Wendy from the Hook.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Peter walks to the window,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Another failed poem brought from futile inspiration.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He can fly he can fly.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Tinkerbelle’s opiates burn his lobes.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The window ledge is now the kingdom of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">the drunk,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
dry stanzas flow like ash from his lips.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He can fly he can fly.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He is ready for the greatest trip.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Alas good fortune emerges. He steps away from the throne,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
tears taste the lips. Hope bubbles from his stomach.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
His anguish breaths in and out<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
the beaten lungs the reality of his horror mumbles to his heart.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But the muse oozes back;<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
the drunken haze combines<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
with the opiate mist and falls back.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Inspiration has come.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He rips the pen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">from his breast pocket and<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
rapes his notebook for words.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The anguish, the hate and the abyss<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
spill out from the pen into the brutal shape of a poem,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
a poem of wonderful panicked desperation.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Stanzas of bottle</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lust cantos of hate<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

It is finished,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
his poem.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The hazy thought that saved him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">from the abyss<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Proud of his opus<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
this poem<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
this hurricane of rotted emotion and hope, he reads it aloud.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Peter Pan Breath’s life onto the page<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
and lets the words spill from his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lungs to the world.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The sounds of pain laced hope slithers down the broken walls,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
a broken lass sheds the tears as the word reaches her ears.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Like a drug she is intoxicated,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
a moth to the flame she flows to the poem.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Then to Peter.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
To his warmth.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
To Wendy, Peter flows, anguish oozes out of<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
him as they share their warmth.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Their moans of heat, their bodies’ groan for the others flesh.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Lust turned too love, a cyclone was tamed.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The pain was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">gone.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Replaced by the joy of another soul.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It could never last,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It could never be,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It would be an abomination.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A cry of damnation to the world.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But Peter and Wendy did not care, they only cared<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
For the Garden of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Eden they represented to each other.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Love that can topple<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Anguished that is drowned<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
How can it last?<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Wendy and Peter did not know, nor did they care.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Their only care was survival. Survival of the joy they had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Survival of the spark that burned now into an inferno.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Then the passion had cooled<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But the flame still there.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The two youths parted, but felt life pump in their veins.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
From the abyss came Peter and from the terror of Hook</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">came Wendy<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But the cards still lay, the game was still going.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
New pieces were to be thrown into the grinder.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
While the two lovers returned to the swill, the dark biker<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Was ready to carry out his will. A beast he was with macabre</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Joys playing on crooked heart strings.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Crooked strings that danced to a hatful desire<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Crooked Strings that rang to a sinful pleasure<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Crooked strings that beat to a monsters game<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Crooked strings</div></div>

When those eyes of his pierced the gaze to her,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
his dark soul churned for another feast to her soul<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
a soul beaten down to the foundation of his wicked kingdom.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But Wendy had the glow</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The flow of life.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
When the hook met the harlot, her fury rang out to a powerful roar<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A roar of defiance<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A roar of release from years of treacherous hedonism.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A roar that transmuted into blows after blow of</div></div>

The biker king de throne, the hook lay in portrait of his blood.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Wendy was alive<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The rush of hate left her arms<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
She felt a vibe in the world.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A vibe of peace<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The lost boys saw it too, the vibe was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">now birthed into the world<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Slipping forth from a womb of agony, the vibe was a scream<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A scream of defiance to the woes of selfish blood spilt.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Selfish blood the croc drank all to eagerly.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Selfish blood that drove Hook to a desire for gore</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Selfish blood that took Hook to the croc.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Selfish blood that forced the croc under command to indulge<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
To indulge in stealing life in the most horrid of dances.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
To indulge in dances of doom.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
So the Croc</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">slithered<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
So the Croc hunted, the aroma of flesh in his nostrils.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The aroma flowing from the lifted heart of our dear little harlot.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The jaws of the crocs snapped<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Snapped her soul into shreads.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Snapped her body</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">into bloody abstraction<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Snapped her life into the black oblivion<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And even though the vibe stayed at never never land<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The vibe that lifted so many hearts and ensured a better day<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The vibe could not stand against a tide of horrors</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Horrors that Peter saw from his window<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He saw the fair flesh of Wendy bled grey,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He saw the fair soul trampled to dust,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He saw the jaws of doom snap shut.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He saw the Hook watching in glee.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The love turned to hate, the calm turned to anger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The vibe became a roar!<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Peter roared from the throne too the dirt below!<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He roared to Hook, he roared to Croc.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And he roared to all the lost youth of the land.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He roared for them to carry out vengeance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And the lost boys heard with their souls.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The croc was beaten dead by many hands,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Many hands carrying blood oaths<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Many hands declaring joy to the doom of croc<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Many hands forced the Hook upwards to a burning hate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
With a fire axe in hand Peter charged through steps,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He charged down the steps to Hook like a deranged Valkyrie<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
With its eyes set on gore.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And Hook Charged upwards eyes burning with an awesome<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Tyranny.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The lost youth cornered the biker king of no throne,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And the king cornered the vengeful prince<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
They met in between lands of Never Never land<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And collided with the force of a monstrous critical mass<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The axe fell from over Peters head</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">as if slamming shut<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A valve that let evil into the world,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The hooked knife of the king thrusted forward.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
In a deadly game their hate locked, the a blade and axe<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Slashed at one and the other, the blades were locked<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Simple additions to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">lifetimes of wondrous agony.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Blood to blood<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Steel to steel<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The dance played on<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Until to the end with one last ugly slash,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Of the axe a river of warm red life surged from the<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Wicked neck of Hook.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And the hooked knife slide out from the</div></div>

Slide out letting loose the flow of Peters soul.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Game<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Set<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Match for the foes<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And the lost boys watched, they watched they anger, this dance of war.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And they sobbed, but felt a great</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 34</a><div class="page-content">burden lifted from Atlas shoulders.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The hook’s life gurgled to hell.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
While Peters life left in a sensation like flight<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A sensation known to all that die.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A sensation known as release.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
For Peter can fly.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He can fly he can fly.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
