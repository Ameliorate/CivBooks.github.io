<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 9</a><div class="page-content">On the day of July 11th, 2012, a Bernd on Krautchan discovered the server known as Civcraft. After learning of the systems at play, the Swede built up a primitive city with a range of 20-30 fellow Bernds. This was the first city of the Fourth Reich,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">a new Nazi Regime with the ambitions to rule Civcraft and its people on a large scale basis. There were many homes and farms and even a chest hall where the community would share everything that was accumulated by it's members.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">A few days later, it was discovered that there were forces of autism on the land of the Fourth Reich. Evil and hated Autist, Stevo_1066 decided to visit the city of Bernds after the Swede tried to make diplomacy. Upon entering the city, Stevo_1066 claimed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">that the entire continent was his property and threatened the Bernds with death if they did not leave. The Bernds drew their swords and surrounded Stevo_1066 and requested that he leave the city or else he would risk death himself. An ultimatum in defense</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">of Stevo_1066's aggression. Stevo_1066 then turned to the help of the civcraft subreddit where he delivered claims that the Bernds were hostile and threatened to force him off his land without any words of his own aggression. Hours later, the Bernds were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">attacked by Stevo_1066 and the Romans, a powerful faction geared with diamond armor and weapons, and were sent into the End where they were trapped.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">An arbitration was then held for the fate of the members of the Fourth Reich in which the Bernds lost everything they owned. Boojamon, the arbitrator was not as fair as he made himself out to be and Stevo_1066 ended up claiming not only the entire Bernd</div></div>
