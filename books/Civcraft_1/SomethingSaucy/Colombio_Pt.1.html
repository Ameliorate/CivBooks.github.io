<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It was dark. Raining. Thunder echoed through the halls of Dossy Manor. The eerie paintings of Columbia’s founders hung throughout the hallways, their gaze ever piercing, their faces ever present. The current president, John Eden, had made it</div></div>

He knew what the real Columbians had wanted in their state. He openly apposed President Eden, a dangerous stance to take. Not only that, but Richard had found out something. Something big. But</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Richard had been quiet for too long. He had to speak up. And he was going to tomorrow.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
As he made his way down the darkened halls to his study, Richard heard a noise. Was it just the thunder? Yes. Yes, just the thunder. He continued</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">towards the study with a quickened pace. Was that the noise again? Sweat was dripping down his brow. Just as he thought he’d pass out, he made it to the study, slamming the door behind him with a crack. Then all was quiet. It was as if the thunder and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">rain had stopped. Nothing moved. And then a creak in the wood. Was it in the study? No, no, no, it couldn’t have been. Probably just hoodlums running around outside. But then he heard the creak again. All was quiet. Even as he noticed his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">shadow at the opposite end of the room, it was quiet. Even when he saw the faint muzzle flash, everything was quiet. And as he fell to the ground, bleeding, all was quiet.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It was 4 a.m. as Detective Jimmy McAdams stumbled back into his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">apartment. He had been drinking again. He was breaking the custody agreement by doing that. Sarah wouldn’t let him see the kids if he didn’t pass the weekly alcohol test. And it was Friday.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But it was just one of those nights, a dark depressing night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It was okay if he had a few beers. Or nine. He could stop whenever he needed to. Jimmy got into bed but before he could drift away into drunken bliss, his phone rang.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Yeah what is it?” He answered.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“It’s Richard, Jim. He’s dead.” It was commissioner</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Williams.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Christ,” Jimmy breathed. “Murdered?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Shot three times. One in the chest, two in the back of the head.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Where? The manor?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Yeah. We just got here. Look Jim, if you don’t want-“<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“I’ll be there,” He said as he hung up the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">phone.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy was often criticized for being a straight cop. In a city like Columbia, it was customary for cops to look the other way for general P distribution, and to take bribes from the crime families. It was all in equilibrium, the only losers in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the deal were the actual Columbian citizens who were constantly under fear of the law enforcement, the criminals, and even the politicians. But Jimmy thought he could improve the system. At least at first. The only thing that kept him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">straight was his old partner, Bunk was also clean. But he died, meaning Jimmy had to be the clean one. And what a fucking joy that was.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy had always considered Commissioner Williams to be a decent guy and a good friend. But he suspected</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">he was on several dirty politicians’ payroll. Not that unusual.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy arrived at the manor a quarter before 5 in the morning. Still dark. Still raining. Williams and Detective Arnold McGinnis greeted Jimmy as he got to the door. McGinnis was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">one of the more obvious dirty cops. Press had already got there. Multiple police cars blocked the roads near the square, the red and blue lights seemed to hit every darkened corner of the sinful city. This was going to be a cluster fuck in the morning,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Jimmy thought.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The three of them walked through the hallways, paintings of old men staring down at them. They reached the study where several other officers stood taking pictures of the scene. Richard had spent much time in the study, but by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">look of the amount of dust, he hadn’t used it in a while. Jimmy and Richard shared many laughs and beers in that room. Now it was a dusty tomb, with Richard Hamilton lying face down in a heap, blood covering the wood flooring underneath him. The back</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of his head had two chunks missing. Jimmy rolled over on his side to see the first hit, a couple of inches beneath the heart. Richard’s eyes had rolled back by this point, leaving a ghostly stare at Jimmy.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“He was standing when the first hit got</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">him. Looks like the gunman was standing over there, in front of the window waiting for him,” Jimmy started.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“How do you know that? He could’ve followed him in,”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“If he had followed he could’ve just shot him once in the head. The chest shot</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">shows that the gunman didn’t want to risk missing a headshot since it was dark and he was on the opposite end of the study,” It was a rather large study. “Then to make sure he was dead, the two shots to the back of the head after he had fallen down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Pretty typical assassination. Any prints pulled yet?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The Commissioner spoke up, “Place is clean. Whoever did this is a pro. Knew what he was doing, that’s for sure.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Okay. McGinnis, look through past cases for two shots to the back of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">victim’s head,” Jimmy ordered.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
McGinnis looked at him begrudgingly but then went off. The Commissioner and Jimmy stood a while longer in silence. “I didn’t ever think Richard would be the type to get involved in the mafia,” Williams said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He wasn’t and Jimmy knew that. But why? For political reasons? Richard was opposed to the current regime, but it’s not like he could do anything. Richard’s pull in Columbian politics dwindled around the time of the failed justice systems</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">reform. It could be an old rival, Jimmy thought. But even that seemed a stretch. Political rivals stopped killing each other a long time ago, opting for the more ‘refined’ approach of slandering during public forums.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Maybe Richard</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">found something out. Something big.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Maybe,” Jimmy said. “Was anything removed from the manor recently?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Not by us. Not yet anyway.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy started looking around the room. He looked though the history section. Various tomes on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the cities of Rift and Cressmopolis dotted the shelf. Jimmy had always known Richard had a fascination with early AnCap cities. More recent works were on the other shelves, still covered in dust however. “The Lazuli-Jack War” was a bestseller, though</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">it looked like Richard hadn’t even once looked through it. But then another book caught his eye. This one wasn’t as dusty, and the dust hadn’t settled as much as it had on the other ones. Richard had obsessed over this book, it seemed. It was called</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“The Ancap Conspiracy: The Failed Lazuli Coup.” Richard wasn’t normally into conspiracy fiction, so this was odd. Jimmy took it off the shelf and slid it into his bag.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Back at home, Jimmy opened up the book. The sun had risen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">about an hour ago, but Jimmy wasn’t tired. He could sleep later. The book was written about three years ago by Nathaniel of Lazuli. He’d need to contact Nathaniel if this proved interesting. All this was odd to Jimmy, The Lazulian Republic and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Columbia had never had much interest in each other, so why would Richard, a Columbian to the bone, have a book on Lazulian politics? He popped it open anyways.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“The little known attempted AnCap coup of Lazuli was an event during the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">years of Saucy the Founder in which an ancap, Toshibi Maru, attempted to sieze control of the Republic and dissolve the government, effectively rendering the cities of Lazuli into anarchy and spreading the influence of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Anarcho-capatilism”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Ugh, Jimmy thought, this is painful. The history channel already has plenty of this shit, why was Richard reading this? Before he could answer his own question, the phone rang.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“What?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Yeah I found out</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">who matches that MO from the Hamilton murder”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Who? You got a name?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Yeah but good luck finding him. He’s a wanted fugitive from Rome. Maurelius. We got about 3 murders in the last year with the two gunshots to the back of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">head, like Hamilton’s wounds. One of them had several eyewitnesses who pinned the murder on Maurelius. But we have yet to detain him. And that was the last time he had been in Columbia.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Alright thanks, Arnold.” It wasn’t uncommon for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Romans to join Columbian criminal organizations, especially if they got to kill other Columbians. Romans and Columbians never got along. Jimmy left his apartment and headed to the subway, bound for Kizantium. Maybe on the two hour ride</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">he could get some shut eye.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Awaking with a headache, Jimmy got off the subway. Instead of sleeping he had drank more. But it was one of those days. He could stop whenever he wanted to. He made it topside and was greeted by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">sand stone structures of Kizantium, which dotted the countryside of Rome. Jimmy had a friend in Rome, someone with intimate knowledge of many of the criminals of Rome. Jimmy was to meet him in the bar. He went and checked into a hotel and then</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">made for the bar.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy met Daxius at the bar a few hours later. The two friends shared a couple of laughs before getting down to business.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Do you know a Maurelius? Hitman, did some jobs in Columbia,” Jimmy asked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Doesn’t sound familiar. But then again, Maurelius is a very common name for Romans. It’s probable that he chose a fake one.” Daxius answered.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Well what about his MO? Recognize that?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Now that does sound familiar. I knew a hitman a few years</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">ago named Mars who took to shooting his contracts twice in the head. But he’s believed to be dead.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Believed?” Jimmy smiled. He was getting somewhere.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Exactly. I hear the way you can get into contact with him is through a bar in Barnabie</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Beaches.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Damn, that shithole?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Hey now, don’t damage my Roman pride, McAdams! Just head to that bar and talk to the owner, an Augustan named Charlie. Then come back and let me know what you found.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Thanks Daxius.” Jimmy made his way</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">towards Barnabie Beaches.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
When he got there, it was nearly 3 o’ clock. Still hadn’t slept. Jimmy walked into the smoky bar and made his way to the bar.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“What’ll ya have, stranger?” The bartender asked.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“I need to speak to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Charlie. Detective Jim McAdams, CPD.” That one got Jimmy a few crooked looks from the patrons of the rundown bar.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Well I’m Charlie. What do you need exactly?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Looking for a hitman. Marcus. Goes by Maurelius sometimes.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“And why would I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">tell you any info on an assassin? You’re a cop. And a Columbian, no less.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“I’m not here to arrest him,” Jimmy lied, “I’m here for his services.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Charlie looked him up and down, “They ain’t lyin when they say youse Columbian cops are dirty. I’ll ring</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">him for ya.” But then Richard slipped. His gaze blinked from Jimmy to the corner of the bar. Just for one second. It was all Jimmy needed. He immediately turned in time to see a dark haired Roman leap up from his table and head towards the door. Jimmy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">ran after him, chasing him through the streets of Barnabie. Jimmy caught up to him and slammed him to the ground.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Marcus? Or Maerelius? Which would you refer on your tombstone?” Jimmy quirked.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Stupid fuck. Rome will never extradite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">me. They’d try me for themselves. And I’ll just be out in a few years.” Marcus retorted.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Who hired you to kill Richard?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“Richard? Which one was that?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“The old guy. Killed last night.”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Marcus laughed. “You best stay out of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that one, little guy”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jimmy punched him in the face, right as the Roman Guard arrived. They threw Jimmy off and roughed him up a bit. “Why the fuck is a Columbian cop here arresting Roman citizens?”<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
“I’m not arresting anyone. Just riling</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">up an old friend.” Jimmy made his way back to Kizantium. It was late and he decided to retire to his hotel room before meeting up with Daxius and telling him what he found. The hotel room was dark and quiet. The faint sound of Legionnaires patrolling</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the streets below echoed throughout the empty room. But Jimmy wasn’t tired. He had just chased a Roman through the streets of Barnabie and was going to have a goddamn drink. But before he made it out the door, he was knocked out.</div></div>
