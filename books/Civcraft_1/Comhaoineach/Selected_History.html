<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Introduction:<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It's important to note that HCF is more of an ethnic group than a clan or army. Some have compared them to Mongols or Huns destroying the old establishment barbarically. Although</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 35</a><div class="page-content">currently (31/12/12) it remains unseen as to what will come with their victory or defeat. However Is hould re-iterate that not all HCF peoples are part of these violent 'hordes' some claim to be peaceful immigrants to Civcraftia. Whilst an anarchical</div></div>

They have conducted indiscriminate pearlings, killings, lootings and destruction throughout the server. I am however biased as I was killed by one such HCF Vandal called</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The Start:<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Various troubles in their homelands led to The HCF people's exodus into Civcraftia in a manner similar to that of the Goths or Huns. These HCF peoples were and still are millitary experts with battlefield skills</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 35</a><div class="page-content">honed in the violent lands of the HCF. Many treated Civcraftia in a similar manner using their skills to obtain equipment from Civcraftians they had murdered. Another symptom of this influx of HCF was increased greifing throughout the server with major</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 35</a><div class="page-content">cities suffering lava and cobblestone genrator attacks. However many were more preocccupied with the Leftist uprising in the Augustan district of New Kowloon, the uprising was allegedly incited by ZL the leader of Leningrad. Within a few hours ancaps and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 35</a><div class="page-content">residents had quelled the street fighting and order was restored. A week or two later another controversial event rocked the server. A team of HCF had cracked the vault of the famed ancap foofed. The God TTK2 felt that this must have been acheieved</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 35</a><div class="page-content">with illegal supernatural measures such a X-raying. So TTK2 banished them from the realm before they could release all of Foofed's prisoners from his vault. But cries of unfairness led to their unbanning as they had done nothing illegal. But</div></div>

Certain HCF made it their mission to rain terror on Civcraftia until this perceived injustice of exile was righted. They also claimed a desire to 'liberate' the</div></div>

Although they went about this in a millitaristic fashion killing and pearling players and destroying their hard work spent on the development of cities. While some HCF fighters claim to wage a political war many are in it for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 35</a><div class="page-content">sheer thrill of combat and destruction. This was shown by HCF warriors claiming to murder for "teh lulz"<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
or when Chris754w claimed that his political position was a "rapist" suggesting a lack of political belief that the traditional Civcraftians held</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 35</a><div class="page-content">proudly. Although Chris was against Ancaps even if he is unlikely to have understood even the basic concepts of anarcho-capitalism. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The HCF are divisive among civcraftians as they have no central command and no group goals. Some in Tigertaden claim that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 35</a><div class="page-content">they are reasonable<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
and shouldn't be discriminated against. whilst ithers particularly those affected by the war a more Anti-HCF with calls of forming militias to help the world police force which is fighting the HCF Warriors and seems to be the underdog.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Reports claim that the once prosperous Mt. Augusta is now reduced to a ghostly wasteland as a result of HCF destruction. Whilst nether travel has become impossible especially for the underequiped or less martially skilled of Civcraftia. Cities like</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 35</a><div class="page-content">by Foofa and DR. Although a few HCF were killed eventually both DR and Foofa fell to HCF warriors and to this day lie in the end, pearled for their resistance. A major problem was the military incompetence of this Anti-HCF force. With some soldiers</div></div>

Now:<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Currently as a Tigerstadian I live in a much more parnoid environment than previously. Every day we hear Anti-HCF propaganda and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 35</a><div class="page-content">many world police members call Civcraftia to fund the war effort with production.

thank you dear reader for perceivering with such a long and dull volume as this. I hope to have recorded a little of Civcraftia's rich history with as much accuracy and as little bias as possible. I also want to add that the time between these</div></div>
