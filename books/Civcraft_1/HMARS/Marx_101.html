<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Unless you failed all your history classes in school or are simply not paying attention, you probably know that Karl Marx was a 19th-century political philsopher, and that he is most widely known for essentially inventing modern communism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 27</a><div class="page-content">But what exactly did Marx write about? What could have so revolutionized politics, both in Marx's day, through the 20th century, and today? This short Minecraft volume, created specifically for Civcraft, aims to answer these very questions.</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The core of Marx's whole philisophy is what is known as "dialectical materialism." Many of Marx's writing and analysis is significantly less abstract-sounding, but they are all conceptually rooted to this "dialectics."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 27</a><div class="page-content">"Dialectics" is basically a fancy word conveying the fundamental opposition of two ideas or forces. "Materialism" of course means that this "Dialectics" is applied to real, material stuff, and not just to ideas or to some sort of unphysical abstraction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">For Marx, the fundamental opposition in the world comes out thusly: the interests of "capital" and "labor" are fundamentally and inreconcilably opposed! When a worker produces something with his work, whether it be cotton or a spreadsheet</div></div>

In doing this work, the worker recieves some sort of wage, salary or subsistence; to not starve, they must do work. That worker, perhaps obviously,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 27</a><div class="page-content">embodies labor. The fundamental opposition comes out when we realize that the accumulation of capital (that is, of profits, of stuff by a company, et cetera) is completely opposed to the interests of the worker! For the company to grow, more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 27</a><div class="page-content">work must be extracted from the workers, more workers must be employed (and thus value extracted from the new workers as well), or the workers must be paid less for their work.

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
In a less economic, and more political context, Marx develops his notions of "capital" and "labor" into more socialpolitical concepts of class. Embodying the concept of "capital" is the class of the "bourgeois."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 27</a><div class="page-content">The bourgeois do not get their money from laboring; theirs is a situation of privilege; they make money by owning stuff. Corporate stakeholders, real estate speculators, and landlords are the most obvious examples; their wealth comes from ownership.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 27</a><div class="page-content">The class that embodies labor, on the other hand, is the "proletariat." The proletarians do not own big profitable property or the like; their only way of subsisting (that is, not starving) is to sell their labor power; that is, they are employed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 27</a><div class="page-content">for some wage or salary. If a proletarian can't work, they don't have any proper source of income. Most people can't afford to eat and have a place to live if they don't have a job; thusly they are proletarians.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Since the bourgeois own all the fundamental building blocks of the economy (the "means of production" in Marxist parlance), they exert enormous sociopolitical power. Even if a system is nominally democratic, voting and political power in general,</div></div>

Excellelent modern examples would be American "Super PACs" or "Too big to fail" banks in which corporations, banks, and thusly their</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It is important to note that Marx does not confine himself solely to this brutally simple dichotomy; he is more subtle in his model. First is the concept of the "petty-bourgeois." In essence, the petty-bourgeois is the small-business</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 27</a><div class="page-content">segment of the middle class; they at least nominally own some relatively small amount of property, from which they derive some sort of living; a prime example would be a small-time shopkeeper.

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Marx's other big nuance is the "lumpenproletariat;" they are proletarians, in that they must exchange labor for subsistence, but their roles are entirely parasistic, and will</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Of course Marx, and Communism like him, are fundamentally interested in a revolutionary situation which utterly deposes the bourgeois from power and supplants it with a communal situation, in which all the means</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 27</a><div class="page-content">of production, such as factories, farms, offices, etc. are held in common as communal property, rather than as the property of the now-smashed bourgeois. For Marx, the proletariat was already a "class unto itself;" that is, a cohesive class unit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 27</a><div class="page-content">What remains is for the proletariat to become a class FOR itself, realizing that it did not need the bourgeois or the exploitation they embody.
