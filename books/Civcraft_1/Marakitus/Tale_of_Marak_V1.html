After wandering around aimlessly for a while, I come across a large town known as Mt. Augusta. There had been some murder and pearling there, but it wasnt too bad. I asked around about joining a town, when I meet a guy named</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Dabobscotts. He says that I seem like a legit player, and we go to his old town, leaving Augusta, and heading for the abandoned town of Xanadu.

Thats when I told my friends about CivCraft. Around 5 of them joined Xanadu, and we a nice peaceful</div></div>

But then, unexpectedly, while my friend Ollyg_99 and I are walking around the town, minding our own business, these two guys come up and say we're friendly. There were HCF, and we knew they were. Olly and I scouted around our town, looking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content">for them. They were in the town centre, and thought I was alone.
They were wrong.
I was only in iron armour, while one of them was in full diamond (the other iron), and I charged at one. I had a few pots at my disposal and managed to kill the guy in iron</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 23</a><div class="page-content">while olly was fending off the guy in diamond. The guy in diamond ran for his life, we gave chase. He managed log, but we stayed around for a little while. He came back on and we owned him, taking all his gear. Thats we knew we had to leave.
We stayed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 23</a><div class="page-content">for a little while longer, and in that time, two of my other friends managed to get into some trouble, stealing stuff out of the town halls chests.
They werent pearled or killed but Dabobscotts made sure his was repayed.
Olly, I and another friend left</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Xanadu, and travelled. Travelled far to the edge of the map, passing through ruins of old towns, farms and houses, till we found our spot.</div></div>

My two friends and I 
started a little underground town. But peace yet again was short lived. G0rdge demanded that I told the coords Aldyamos or something, or he would come kill us and raid us. He said he'd been tracking us using</div></div>

One of my friends left CivCraft alltogether, while the other and I headed to town called Buenos Aires. That was where another one of my friends I introduced to CivCraft had gone,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content"> Pucker678. Pucker then became the Minister of Defense for Buenos Aires. Olly and I decided to live there.

But I was (still am) not the one to settle down in one place so I left angrily and was off to travel.</div></div>

After I left Buenos Aires with most of my valuables, I was weary of using the nether, because of HCF and random killings and pearlings so I set off. 
I decided I would head for Nine, mainly because it was relatively safe, and alot of</div></div>

On my way to Nine I came across a few people on the chat. They were weary of me at first but the the nice people of carbon eventually let me in, and I gave them a</div></div>

When I get there it was a different story. It had been griefed abit and the residents were scared. I left quickly and decided Buenos Aires was the best place. I stopped by Danzilona to say hi to my 'friend</div></div>

Now he was on a roll with Adhavoc and Theodius, catching griefers and muderers but, when I decided to use their portal to get back to Buenos Aires through the nether, it was when HCF was having a tantrum.
