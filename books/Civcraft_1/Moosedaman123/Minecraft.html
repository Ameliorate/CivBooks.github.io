       Mooshroom
The Mooshroom is, most likely, one of the more... crazy animals Minecraft has to offer. With big, black eyes, red and white hide, and toadstools growing on their back, these are not a common animal, and are found in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">only one biome, the Mushroom Biome. They prefer to be near mushrooms, be it brown or white, and are sometimes found naturally spawned on the huge fungus called the Huge Mushroom.</div></div>

Characteristics of the       Mooshroom
Mooshrooms have similarities to normal cows, such as they can be milked with buckets to get milk,
they drop leather and raw beef when killed, and still breed with wheat bunches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">But Mooshrooms are also very different from the common domesticated cow, with unnatural characteristics one is sure to enjoy, such as they are a source of infinite food, the mushroom stew, which one can milk with a wooden bowl. Second, they can be sheared</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">and transformed into a normal cow, dropping red fungi, but unfortunately, this change cannot be reversed. They prefer their homeland grass, Mycelium, which is a dull pink-purple color in contrast to our bright green normal grass.</div></div>

 Owning a Mooshroom
If you plan to own a mooshroom (or two), be sure to have these essential thngs listed.

Mycelium- Mycelium is essential for mooshroooms, and one cannot lve without it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">A Decent Size Pen-
Don't cram your mooshrooms! Be sure to at least have a 5x5x3 pen at the ready for your new animal.

Fungi- Don't leave your pen floor barren-add some fungi to it!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Your Mooshroom will enjoy having these little plants around, so be sure to have a few in your pen for them.

Wheat- If you need leather of beef, be sure to have a small wheat farm or a little bit of wheat to breed these animals.</div></div>

 The Habitat of the
      Mooshroom
The Mooshroom is found in only one biome, the Mushroom Biome, where instead of tall grass grows small fungi, instead of grass grows the strange Mycelium, and instead of trees grows the Huge Mushroom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Here is some info on the things you will find in the Mushroom Biome

Mycelium-Similar but different to the Grass Block, they possess similar qualities such as it grows on dirt     (within radius), when broken without an item with silk touch it yields a</div></div>

Huge Mushroom-
These large mushrooms, only naturally spawning in the Mushroom Biome,</div></div>

The red cap of the Huge Red Mushroom, the brown cap of the Huge Brown Mushroom, and the stalk of both. All of these have a chance to yield few mushrooms, making these a great source of food.

These can be grown from mushrooms by using bonemeal on them.</div></div>
