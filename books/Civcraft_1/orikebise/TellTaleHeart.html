by Edgar Allen Poe
TRUE! -- nervous -- very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses -- not destroyed -- not dulled them. Above all was the sense of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 47</a><div class="page-content">hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily -- how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 47</a><div class="page-content">entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 47</a><div class="page-content">was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees -- very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 47</a><div class="page-content">than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 47</a><div class="page-content">that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! --would a madman have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously --oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 47</a><div class="page-content">--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 47</a><div class="page-content">vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 47</a><div class="page-content">profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 47</a><div class="page-content">before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 47</a><div class="page-content">chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 47</a><div class="page-content">fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 47</a><div class="page-content">bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 47</a><div class="page-content">hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 47</a><div class="page-content">overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 47</a><div class="page-content">felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 47</a><div class="page-content">could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 47</a><div class="page-content">suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 47</a><div class="page-content">--although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 47</a><div class="page-content">opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 47</a><div class="page-content">upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 47</a><div class="page-content">well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 47</a><div class="page-content">--do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 47</a><div class="page-content">refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 47</a><div class="page-content">into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 47</a><div class="page-content">did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 47</a><div class="page-content">pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more. If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 47</a><div class="page-content">First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 47</a><div class="page-content">human eye -- not even his --could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I had made an end of these labors, it was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 47</a><div class="page-content">four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 47</a><div class="page-content">perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 47</a><div class="page-content">premises. I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 47</a><div class="page-content">them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 47</a><div class="page-content">perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 47</a><div class="page-content">chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --it continued and became more</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 47</a><div class="page-content">distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 47</a><div class="page-content">voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath -- and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 47</a><div class="page-content">the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 47</a><div class="page-content">observations of the men -- but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 47</a><div class="page-content">It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror! --this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 47</a><div class="page-content">I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! --and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 47</a><div class="page-content">louder! -- "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! --here, here! --it is the beating of his hideous heart!"</div></div>
