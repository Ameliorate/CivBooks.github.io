<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I am Xataz, I live at Whitedog Farm, an expansive farm in the shallow -,+, with my friends, colleagues and brother. As of now, we are all iron clad. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Whitedog is not a political place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 40</a><div class="page-content">It was founded in the heat of the HCF war, around Christmas, so politics didn't matter to many who joined.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
My brother and I, who support the empowered proletariat and left wing ideals, were forced into comradeship amongst voluntaryists and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 40</a><div class="page-content">like. We saw occaisional glimpses of the harsh war, but for the most part, the entire server seemed elsewhere. We were fed, safe(ish) and happy, for a while. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
This shall not become a memoir of times spent in Whitedog. So I shall move swiftly on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Whitedog had become gripped by the hands of the bourgeois. A monopoly was placed on some town resources, a schism tore across the land, and my brother and I seeked more. More politics, more of a nation and sense of community. That was when we decided to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 40</a><div class="page-content">part ways with the borgeois, and seek a red paradise, a diamond in the rough.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We departed for Buenos Aires.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
After a long yet eventful journey through our local nether portal, we appeared through the portal in Buenos</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Aires. We were welcomed with open arms by ministers, premiers and comrades alike. We were quickly put to work in the cobblestone factory, as our firm Defense Minister lectured us on what to do in the<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
event of an attack on the city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 40</a><div class="page-content">The Defense Minister, Pucker, seemed to not have political or intellectual prowess, but I was assured that he was excellent on the battlefield. Why else would our Glorious Premier entrust him with the safety of the city?<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He gifted me a strength potion,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 40</a><div class="page-content">and promptly left. I was shown to my new apartment. A small, dank room above my workplace. "Aha!" I thought, "Here shall be the beginnings of my ascent amongst the Leninist heirarchy!".<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Later on, ZombieLenin lectured us on how the city is run, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 40</a><div class="page-content">external political affiliations.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I had finished some work for the day, so I sat down in my humble apartment, and read an issue of the People's News Today, like a good comrade.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I fell asleep, happy to have found a red</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 40</a><div class="page-content">paradise.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It was on the second day, that I met my good comrades Asda and Dambem. Dambem was relatively new to the city, as I was, so our friendship was made to endure. Comrade Asda was the minister of ideology, the three of us shared many a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 40</a><div class="page-content">debate and discussion on the topics of literature and ideology.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
When asked by comrade Asda as to my housing situation, he told me that more apartments needed to be built. I took this as a challenge to prove my worth to this city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 40</a><div class="page-content">I sketched out designs for an apartment complex, located a spot to put it on, and applied for a building permit.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
In the meantime, comrade Dambem had gotten the same idea about proving his worth to the city. He constructed a statue</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 40</a><div class="page-content">of our Glorious Premier's favourite chicken, as displayed in the Buenos Aires museum, Shasa, in the trade expansion town of Shasagrad.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Having recently slain a spider, I brought some P over to celebrate his work. My boss, Hughwoodbury, told</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 40</a><div class="page-content">me that P clouds the mind. I was curious as to the city's stance on P, but I could get away with having some in Shasagrad with Dambem on occassion, surely.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
On my P crazed stupor back to Buenos Aires, the large, welcoming statue of ZombieLenin<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
welcomed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 40</a><div class="page-content">me. Oh how nice it was to have such a glorious, knowing and<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
understanding premier. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
In my mail, I found that I had been given permission to building plans had been accepted! I began work on the planned apartment building.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">After these events, a large period of doing nothing in particular ellapsed. ZombieLenin, much to our confusion, announced his allegience with the HCF, I was assured by my comrades that this was our Glorious Premier's humour. However it did raise a few</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 40</a><div class="page-content">eyebrows, even though remnants of HCF raids still exist to this day in Buenos Aires (DRO phalluses, anyone?).<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But then, amongst the boredom, the apartments were finished! Comrade Dambem and I moved in, along with lots of other relatively new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 40</a><div class="page-content">comrades. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I was confused by some of the private property that my comrades seemed to own, however this must have been part of the heirarchy, surely. But surely this was in essence, not for the good of the proletariat. Those</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 40</a><div class="page-content">who worked got nil in return, those who fanned the Glorious Premier received glory free of charge. No. I am thinking against the People's Revolution. The Premier is always right. Always...<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Denmark302 made a grand reappearance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 40</a><div class="page-content">He is still wanted as a traitor to the state. He was quickly pearled, and his trial is on Friday.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I had a strange encounter with comrade Asda, also. He asked me my opinion on the trial, and I told him the doubts I had had of Glorious Premier's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 40</a><div class="page-content">system. He was understanding, but I couldn't help thinking that he was secretly still with the Glorious Premier. That was until he handed me a book. It was entitled "The Yugoslavian Constitution". I was amazed. It systematically sorted out the problems I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 40</a><div class="page-content">had with Buenos Aires.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And then he uttered the words "This isn't a plan for a new town, this is a plan for a revolution". It felt as if all of Buenos Aires had flipped upside down. Victory Tower, a subterranean pinnacle. If the members of the government</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 40</a><div class="page-content">were against the Premier, what would happen?<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Comrade Asda was, after all, minister of ideology. He showed me to the outskirts of the city, where a large Yugoslavian flag had been built for all to see. This "coup" was real, and it seemed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 40</a><div class="page-content">that I was against the Glorio- no, just Premier.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The Buenos Aires coup happened in early 2013. The SFRY (Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia) seized control of the city, burnt the now cold, harsh statue. There was no clear</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 40</a><div class="page-content">plan, it was just a blind rush at Denmark302's trial. ZombieLenin was killed. The city was ours, until ZombieLenin's HCF bulldogs were called in. Two of us were pearled, but they were released, the Yugoslavs were exiled.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We took refuge in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 40</a><div class="page-content">nearby town of Cydonia, before quickly moving on, across the quadrants, to New Pyongyang (the CCC one).<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We travelled across the [REDACTED] and arrived in NPY. There we stayed, amongst out comrades, while we regeared, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 40</a><div class="page-content">planned Belgrade.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We spent at least a week there, grinding, mining and talking, and I was kitted out in Prot IV.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
But we decided that enough was enough, and set out to found Belgrade. Unfortunately, I was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 40</a><div class="page-content">mudered by the villainous, evil murderer SoggyLettuce, and lost my prot ( :( ).<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Eventually, we reached a mining outpost. Vanilla chunks! But, alas, it was too near to another town, so we set up at around -1000 -1000. We built</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 40</a><div class="page-content">the Capital Building. My brother's project "Cuber" took off, we found many riches.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
One day, a group of people calling themselves SPQR. They accused us of building on their land, when we had waited two weeks to see if it was disputed. They killed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 40</a><div class="page-content">some of us, and were casually racist in chat. They barged into our Capital Building and placed a sign which said "Yugoslavia will never achieve anything". We were outnumbered, but then help came from the glorious Comintern. The alliance of authoritarian</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 40</a><div class="page-content">leftist states, and also from ZombieLenin. We were about ready to strike, until the Gondolin got involved. SPQR was declared a city state of theirs.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We didn't want to start a new war, so we carried on and tried to make peace. It succeeded, and for a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 40</a><div class="page-content">brief moment, the Twin Cities existed in perfect harmony.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Then, ZombieLenin and his Coalition of the Willing, stormed Aristopolis, protecting Ondolin. ZombieLenin offered help to Yugoslavia, to vanquish SPQR, but we<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
refused, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 40</a><div class="page-content">combined forces of SFRY and SPQR drove the "help" away.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
At this point, we were thinking of moving. While we were quite established in our location, we didn't want another city in chat range. Some of us wanted to move, some didn't. We found a new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 40</a><div class="page-content">location in shallow +,+ 2k away from our allies in Communa.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And then, Titanav came. Obviously an alt, he dedicatedly griefed our capital building, whilst we were sleeping. We sold te land to SPQR, and moved to the new location.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Belgrade took off at the new location. We quickly were gathering resources, rebuilt the Capital Building, made apartments, and set up the quota system. It seems that CivCraft has entered a new era. An era of new towns, allies, enemies and drama. But I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 40</a><div class="page-content">care not for drama, as it is an annoyance. The large conflicts of this server are not fought out by battles<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
and the movement of swords. They are fought out by public relations, and will to carry on. The first side to break the others morale wins. If</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
In the time since deciding to end this book, I travelled back to Whitedog. What I found was a griefed, abandoned mess. From signs around town, I was able to piece together what had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 40</a><div class="page-content">happened after I'd left. It is a rare occurence that I stumble upon an abandoned settlement that I know the mystery behind. Our fields were tramples, till grass grew over them, slipping back into nature's grip.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
And so here we all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 40</a><div class="page-content">are, in this new era. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I leave this book with the thought of the world to come, a new force will probably fill the power vacuum left by the HCF, be it Pan-Leftist or Anarcho-Capitalist (not likely anymore), or a friendly, cooperative ideology</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 40</a><div class="page-content">that exists in new towns. For all towns start with community.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I think of Belgrade in the world to come, and I think it shall be good.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
