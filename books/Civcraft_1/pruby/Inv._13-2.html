Prospectus 2013-2</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The Nine Investment Fund provides a means of investing diamonds in others' enterprises to gain interest. Investors may purchase units directly from the fund at a calculated rate, and sell those back to the fund to redeem their diamonds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Diamonds invested in the fund may be lent to borrowers at the fund managers' discretion. These will be in to loans secured against assets, which allow the fund to reclaim the loan value even if the borrower leaves the server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The unit price of the fund is calculated as the total assets divided by the number of units in issue. The assets will be the value of all funds in secure deposit, plus the value of all current loans. Loan values will be calculated as the proportion of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">repayments remaining multiplied by the original amount lent. This means that any interest on the loan becomes part of the loan's value at the time it is paid, or when successfully reclaimed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The managers will not lend funds beyond 75% of the total value of the fund. This allows a buffer for people to sell their units back to the fund. If too many wish to sell at once, the later sellers may have to wait until loans are repaid or units bought.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">For managing the fund, the managers will receive 25% of any increase in value of the fund. This includes the interest component of repayments and any value forfeited to the fund. This does not include the issue of new units. This is instantaneous gain,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">not gain over time.

While the managers will attempt to minimise risks, investors should understand that to produce a profit some risk must be accepted. Any losses in the fund will be shared equally by all investors as a reduction in unit value.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">All transactions with the fund will be carried out via funds deposited in the Bank of Nine.

To purchase units, please contact pruby in game or on Reddit. Those who wish to become loan managers can do likewise.</div></div>
