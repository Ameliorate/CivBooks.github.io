Many people do not understand the rush that someone on the run feels.  Of course you will be frowned upon in a society, but you will make a sort of close knit group that would understand your imense feeling.  It is hard being a</div></div>

If you are going to be a criminal in civcraft you need to know a few basic things.  First,  people here own snitches (junkboxes) that record your every move.  These can be the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">reason someone loses a trial, and/or why someone has a warrent for their arrest.  There are simply ways to get around snitches like breaking them and getting put on the exception list.  Second, people can rienfocre objects here!!!  This will be a problem</div></div>

But you can use this to your advantage!!!  All you have to do is set down materials (obsidean is a good one) that will make people mad and sad that you have chosen them, and then you just rienforce the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">material.  Rienforcing with diamond is the best.  You can also rienforce with stone (only smooth stone) and also iron ingots.  You can also rienforce chests with pearled people (will talk about later).  This is a great and horrible tool for you and you</div></div>

If your are pearled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">you should try to obtain as many ender pearls as possible.  This is probably going to be the way that they will have you pay reprocutions.  A great tactic is once you obtain 5 pearls say you have obtained the necessary amount and have them realease you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Once they release you immediatly throw the pearl and make a break for it.  If you are lucky they will not be able to follow and you will be free!!!  If you are not lucky make an ALT because chances are you will never be set free.  You can use pearling to</div></div>
