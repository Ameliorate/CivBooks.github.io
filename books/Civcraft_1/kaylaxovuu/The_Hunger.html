In the last decades   interest in hunger artists has declined considerably. Whereas in earlier days there was good money to be earned putting on major productions of this sort uner one's own management, nowadats that is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">totally impossible. Those were different times. Back then the hunger artist captured attention at least once a day. During the later days there were people with subscription tickets who sat all day in front of the small barred cage. And there were even</div></div>

On fine days the cage was dragged out into the open air, and then the hunger artist was put on display particularily for the children. While for grown-ups the hunger artist was often merely a</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">with his ribs sticking out prominently, sometimes nodding politely, answering questions with a forced smile, even sticking his arm out throught the bars to let people feel how emaciated he was, but then completely sinking back into himself, so that he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">paid no attention to anything, not even to what was so important to him, the striking of the clock, which was the single furnishing in the cage, but merely looking out in front of him with his eyes almost shut and now and then sipping from a tiny glass of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">water to moisten his lips.

Apart from the changing groups of spectators there were also constant observeres chosen by the public-strangely enough they were usually butchers-who, always three at a time, were given the task</div></div>

It was, however, merely a formality, introduced to reassure the masses, for those who understood knew well enough that during the period of fasting the</div></div>

The honours of art forbade it. Naturally, none of the watchers understood that. Something there were nightly groups of watchers who</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">could get from some secret supplies. Nothing was more excrutiating to the hunger artist than such watchers. They depressed him. They made his fasting terribly difficult. Sometimes he overcame his weakness and sang during the time they were observing, for</div></div>
