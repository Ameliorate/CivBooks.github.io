<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Starting in roughly January of 2013, a group of members began work on a small community. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
A city called Monova.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The town grew slowly, first with the great tower that stands in its center, and then outward with houses. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
One of the members built a railway around the perimeter, and Monova became known as the City of Rails.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
===================</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">With a portal and a working city center, the town began expanding outward.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
They called themselves the New Civcraftian Order, and sought to bring peace and order to a quadrant that had all but been fragmented since the fall of Columbia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">In the later days of the HCF uprisings, I entered Monova, an emmisary of Evile Corps, a group of people who's location is disclosed to only a select few. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Our goals will stay hidden, but know that we are noble and honor our debts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Monova provided a community to work with as we grew, but the fruits of our labour came but too late.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Evile Corps constucted much of the road work around Monova, providing a network to nearby towns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">This roadwork created a structure for the main road network that connects to Columbia. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
It was however this network that created the beginning of the end of Monova.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">It was one fateful day, shortly after the Valenti Massacre by Josh and friends that I saw HellArchitect.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He was unarmored, wearing nothing, but his pressence curned something inside of me, making me cringe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Once he went through the portal exiting to the Evile Corps Headquarters, I followed and began asking questions. He said he was  searching for a town or village that he had started. In hindsight, it may be the location of his vault, or some treasure cove.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The following day, both HellArchitect and Justin attacked Monova, pearling some of the community and killing others. The town lay griefed, raided and broken.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Raiders later on cleaned up the rest of the town, taking among many things, the rails.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">In the days afterwards, the community dissapated.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
None of the major members were on. People began to move out. The town became a fragment of its former self.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Alone, Evile Corps now stands vigil over the area, guiding travelers and working toward our ultimate goal.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Let this story ring throughout the lands. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Monova fell because of its unwillingness to get back up. Long after HellArchitect is gone, there is still no one in the town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Evile Corps will continue, however we did take a hit to our resources in the fall.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We worked for what we have, and will continue to work for it. All debts are paid and we do not forget our friends.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">If you are interested on learning more about Evile Corps, follow the path to Monova and you will sea the future of civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Until we meet, I wish you luck.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
