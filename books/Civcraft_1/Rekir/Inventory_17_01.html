<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">To Do List:<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Get the expanion.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Get DeRaf his own plot.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Search for Ocelots.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Prepare the search for Mushroom Islands.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Look for way of receiving Soulsand and Nether Warth. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Prepare a Cacti farm. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
- Search for Pumkins.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">IMPORTANT: <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
We lost a lot of wolves and cows today, yet chickens, pigs and sheeps haven't been culled. Some citizens talk about griefers, thus we might need to keep a look out for those. The cow population is going up again, and wolves inside seem safe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I have decided to turn these inventories in some kind of journal. This way I can keep with my tasks and find solutions for old problems. I will write mainly about Watchman_Torch farm and about the fortress DeRaf might build.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">However, you can expect some of the greater tales of Aristopolis in here. It shares it history with Watchman_Torch farm, thus what happens to us, will happen to them. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
I need to find a solution to my wolves jumping up, follow me, and sit down at random.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I believe I have wolves all over town now.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The cows need a larger field, they are pushing eachother out.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The chickens now are plenty to start eating meat regulary. In the world of Civcraft, this is a wonderful event, and surely a blessing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The forest renewall is going good, and without traversing through some trees, people will not see the farm. I am going to keep on expanding the forest, for it will give the others wood, and cover for us.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">The archery range still has some computing issues. Maybe DeRaf can help him a bit. Although, I believe, the randomizer doesn't work well with laggy servers. The lagg isn't that bad, but it is clearly there is some.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">We concluded that we need to decide on what we eat and what we don't. Cows will add to the rotten flesh and feed wolves. Humans will eat chickens.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
On that note, if we were to receive two buckets, we can create endless streams of cake.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Evening report:<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Cow: 9<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Sheep: 1<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Pig: 4<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Chicken: 19<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Wolves: 16<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
These numbers are purely for culling research.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Requested Jagyr to look for a mushroom island.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">He has given me the coords of the closest one. It is in the Minecraft folder, see attached. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Jagyr was also going to ask for a terrain per diamond expansion near my farm. I have to check in later about that.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Came online late. Lost all but 6 wolves, 3 cows, 3 chickens, all piggs, 0 cheeps. It could be a bug in the culling tech, but it could also be a griefer. I might want to report this to Modmail for spawn egg return in case it gets worse.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">This is Rekir signing out on 17/01/2013. Let us pray that the few animals survive and repopulate tomorow.</div></div>
