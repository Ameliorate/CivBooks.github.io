The wayfarer stepped over another branch, that had blocked the demolished cobblestone road.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The wind blew threw the treeptops and made a whistling, almost howling, noise.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Just a few more miles,<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
he thought to himself,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 6</a><div class="page-content">trying to ignore the uneven road and the dark forrest to the left and to the right of him, he desired nothing but a generous meal and a warm bed.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

He slowed down as the silhouettes in the distance finally had definable shapes.<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
As he finally spotted the inn, he took a deep breath and took his last few, and when he</div></div>
