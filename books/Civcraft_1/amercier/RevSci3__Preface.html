Welcome to this first instalment of the re-vitalised and re-organised Revolutionary Science. A brainchild of the LSIF co-founder, bodhidharma, the journal had as its original intention the highlighting and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 21</a><div class="page-content">spotlighting of natural science and technologies related to Minecraft and Civcraft. It regrettably sizzled out after only two issues, though the journal was a success and enjoyed popular readership on the server. Seven months after the publication of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">second issue without a third in the works, I found myself with an idea to present to the public, however I felt a post on the subreddit would not do the idea justice. Compounded with a ubiquitous sense of an anaemic server-wide culture, I assumed the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">position of editor from bodhidharma roughly one month from the time of writing.

As I was the new editor, I undertook some of my own changes to the content within Revolutionary Science. Rather than merely accepting works based out of the social</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">sciences, I instead made them the primary source of published content. Doing so prove to be quite successful, though not on its own right. Within the context of the HCF invasion just before the 2012-2013 Christmas break in Canada and the US, the broad</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">social environment of the server proved to be a veritable mother lode for social, political, and historical analysis. Indeed, the large majority of the works contained within this revitalised edition of Revolutionary Science either deal with the impact of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">the HCF invasion outright orhave the conlifct informing the narrative. Though the conflict in itself may be long-past, we are only now coming to realise the impacts of the invasion and the ensuing power-vacuum left in their dissapearence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">As such the first piece found within the second book of this in-game edition of Revolutionary Science, written by Synthion the phantom anarchist, outlines the HCF conflict within the context of previously existing 'World Police' hegemony and its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">eventual overturning by the HCF as well as the military-tactical and ideological divides impeding the process of a successful counter-movement. The next paper is a difficult one to introduce; it has one foot in Karl Marx's analysis of capital and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">capitalism, one foot in the fictional universe of J.R.R Tolkien, and one foot in our very own Civcraft. Bodhidharma expertly crafts a parallel between Marx's thesis of self-willed capital and Tolkien's thoughts on power, all the while applying this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">criticism to previously existing power structures on Civcraft and their ultimate undoing.

Undoing is certainly a theme in this issue of Revolutionary Science. The third piece reflects on the fall of civilisations in the server with an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">analysis informed by ancient human history. As the author notes, the arrival of a seemingly barbarian force and an apathetic general populace has catastrophic consequences, however the fall of civilisation owing to barbarians is a testament to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">relative success of the Civcraft experiment. Indeed, amercier offers a similar thought in his paper, showing that tribal societies are possible through his case study of the LSIF. However, the sucess of the experiment is short lived, since the absolute</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">poverty in economic development ultimately impedes the passage of tribal societies into modern and complex ones. Finally, this issue ends with a personal retelling of the entire history of the server. Bobpndrgn is a veteran around these parts and he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 21</a><div class="page-content">traces his discovery of the initial iteration of the server known as "Ancap Minecraft" through to it current implementation as Civcraft. The author also traces his personal develoment through the iterations of the server and his migration between</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 21</a><div class="page-content">factions, from the Anarcho-Capitalists to the Libertarian Socialist guild and the LSIF.

The analyses contained in this issue of the HCF conflict are certainly not exhaustive. Indeed the issue is missing a plethora of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 21</a><div class="page-content">perspectives in the debate, from the HCF view, the capitalist view, and the neutral view of those furtive new or capital-poor players who are but the witnesses to a veritable titanomach2. As the editor and the harbinger of these perspectives in these</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">debates, I see with regret the holes left by them. Regardless, the pieces contained within this third edition of Revolutionary Science present an important and high critical view of the conflict and should serve to educate and spur more in depth debate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 21</a><div class="page-content">and discourse on the server.

On a final note, I'd like to issue a few special thanks: to all the contributors, Synthion, bodhidharma, bobpndrgn, and Tambien_Sinclair. I'd like to offer an extra special thanks to bodhidharma for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 21</a><div class="page-content">having pioneered this journal and for lending me his brainchild, thanks. I'd also like to thank all of my comrades in the LSIF for their continued support and friendship.
