Staffenburg

King's Point, at it's height it was a thriving merchant Republic, spanning three islands, providing shelter for resistance members and refugees alike. At it's lowest, she's a badly griefed island with only empty</div></div>

Fort Pike
=======
In the earliest days of the war, shortly after the attack on Mt. Augusta, Cut, Loipers, and I decided to homestead. Cetracey, a close friend and Petran, pointed us towards Fort Arrack. We wandered out of</div></div>

We didn't find a vanilla chunk, but we did find a redstone vein, prompting us to settle at the mouth of a river. It fed into a massive lake, which on the other side, lay Aldaymos and Fort Arrack. Naming it Fort Pike, we</div></div>

We were going to be mutalists, helping each other out as much as possible. Explorers from Arrack, namely Rakkane and Poggalog, greeted us, and invited us into their town. We wandered by and the residents,</div></div>

We soon discovered</div></div>

A New Dawn
=========
Gawdmode had found a mushroom island deep in the Lonely Ocean, one that appeared to have never been touched before. By only the fact that we were the last people to talk to him, he invited us to the island.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It was a long, uneasy boat ride, but we arrived at the shores of this new beautiful island. We got to work, coralling the mooshrooms and building a shelter. The island consisted of one slightly flat area to the east, and a large hill dominating 3/4ths the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the rest of the island. I dug a tunnel straight through it, which would eventually become Pike Ave. In it, I dug out the communal storage and the animal pens. Meanwhile, Loipers was busy digging out an underground farm, and Cut was flatenning the hill.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">We got news from Cetracey that Petra was attacked, and that he needed shelter.

Rakkane, a Fort Arrack citizen and recently pearled, showed up to build an embassy. It was here that Gawdmode asked us to keep the community small, as he feared another Fort Pike incident.

Every citizen from here on was sworn to secrecy. We built no embassies, gave no coords, and had no roads built to us. This was at first beneficial. We could cultivate our community with friends we knew,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">but it bit us in the ass later on. Anyway, we needed a proper govenrment to call our own. We founded the Republic of King's Point, an independent city state dedicated to democracy, justice, and freedom.

Downfall

We had existed for nearly two months now. Now a medium sized town with at least 20 residents, King's Point was fast becoming a major town in the +,+. I however, had a life to attend to, and I slowly stopped growing the</div></div>

What now?

I don't know. I have no plans for the island, and I've since moved my stuff. The empty houses and parks serve as reminders to what once was. I may just leave it there as it is. An empty relic of the HCF war.</div></div>
