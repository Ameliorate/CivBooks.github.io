This was supposed to be a full history of Prussia on the server, from inception of the 4th Reich to the foundation of Danzig. Unfortunately I'm losing internet access and won't be able to finish it as such.

It is not proper to describe Civcraft's Prussian nation without first mentioning the website from which it draws much cultural influence. In _dbb_'s own words: "/int/ is the biggest board on Krautchan, the</div></div>

A Swedish poster made a thread on /int/, bringing to light a minecraft server which promised politics, war, and wealth. Even more interesing: it was run by redditors.</div></div>
