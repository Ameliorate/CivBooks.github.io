<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  There was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the magazine and lay down on the road for a better aim. The crowd grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theatre</div></div>

I ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight for his earhole, actually I aimed several inches in front of this, thinking the brain would be further forward.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

In that instant, in too short a time, one would have thought, even for the bullet to get there, a mysterious</div></div>

He neither stirred nor fell, but every line of his body had altered. He looked suddenly stricken, shrunken, immensely old, as though the frightful impact of the bullet had paralysed him without knocking him</div></div>

At last, after what seemed a long time--it might have been 5 seconds, I dare say--he sagged flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous senility seemed to have settled upon him. One could have imagined him thousands of years old. I fired</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">again into the same spot. At the second shot he did not collapse but climbed with desperate slowness to his feet and stood weekly upright, with legs sagging and head drooping. I fired a third time. That was the shot that did it for him. You could see the</div></div>

And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash that seemed to shake the ground even where i lay.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    I got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud. It was obvious that</div></div>

He was breathing very rhythmically with long rattling gasps, his great mound of a side painfully rising and falling. His mouth was wide open--I could see far down into caverns of pink throat. I waited a long</div></div>

Finally I fired my two remaining shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The thick blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die. His body did not even jerk when the</div></div>
