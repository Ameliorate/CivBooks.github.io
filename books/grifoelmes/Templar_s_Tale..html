<span class="fmt0">By: grifoelmes<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">++++++++++++++++++<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">This book tells a loose rendition of my journey to the Novo Blyat peninsula, to commit my goal. Evangelization of the lands, just as the lord would like it.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">+Deus Vult+</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter I: Departure.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was early in the morning, sun shining in the sky. As our hero grifoelmes, from his bed he did rise.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He looked through the window, heavens so blue above, knowing that of his deeds. History would be made part of.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">He got his equipment ready! Pickaxe, sword and sturdy shield. For this journey, nor his soul nor his armour could yield.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He stepped out into the world, vicious and un-kind. But his objective was set, he wouldn't change his mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter II: The Journey<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The travel itself, was on it's own right. Unrelenting, vicious, dangerous, turning back seemed quite tempting.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">But there was no turning back, not for our hero anymore, his mind was set on representing our God.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The walks were long and harsh, the journeys on the sea dangerous and unknown. But in the end, great tales of his deeds had to be unfold.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And so, with determination, and maybe desperate madness, but he eventually made it, to this place of sadness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter III: Arrival.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was late in the evening as our hero's boat washed ashore, this place's madness could not be ignored.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Water and lava, both together as if brethren, the clouds themselves covering this wasteland so barren.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Our hero laid a bed, a small camp at the peak of the mountain.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"There's a new inhabitant here, just one, but still counting!"<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">These words having been said, the work had begun - The foundations to a chruch, a place of prayer and nuns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter IV: Conflict.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">A week had gone by, the peninsula unrelenting, sending vicious fiends, beasts. Evilness fermenting.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The land rejected our hero, his every step unsettling this ancient earth, a land of madness. Were chaos was given birth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"Even if difficult, rough, and unruly. I will win, for my faith is truly!"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Our hero was determined, but the island even more, the horde of fiends present, made living here a chore.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">But the island came to realize, brute force was useless. To defeat our hero. It would be in cleverness that it would have to be rootless.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And so, the fiends came to a stop, our hero calmly bulding the chapel, refuge and crops.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter V: Trickery.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The island was governed, by 2 witches so foul - just thinking about our hero's righteousness made them growl.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"What should we do?" The elder one said.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"I think we should burn him with nickel and lead!"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"That's quite the good idea, truth to be told - But I think we should go for something not as bold."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"So what should we do then, to this righteous shmuck?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"I know what to do, it'll end with his luck." <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The foul witches shared a nasty laughter, the banishment of the hero would come soon after.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter VI: Poison.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">They came to the hero, disguised with wisdom so kind, offering a drink - To the youngster in his prime.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">They told him it was fine, it would help with his luck! That it wouldn't cause him any kind of 'yuck'.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The hero took a sip, and then a quick chug. Completely oblivious to the fact that he was being drugged.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He fell to the floor, Paralyzed and useless, to the witches his life being worthless.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"What should we do with him?" The elder one asked again.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">But before the other could answer, it began to rain.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The sky became black, the rain thick as clay, as a deep booming voice spoke towards they.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">"Don't even think about it. You couple of fowl whores." <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And who was it talking? Gasp. It was our lord!<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Before the witches could answer, talk or run away. A powerful thunder turning the witches to clay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The hero didn't even realize the glory of his lord, his eyes too busy with the drug's coloured galore.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"You have served me well, my dear little kid - Do live as you wish, as in heaven we will eat of the same dish."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">And that being said, the rain went away. Our hero's sight slowly turning gray.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Chapter VII: Departure.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was now morning, the heavens were clear - Our hero rose up, the time of departure was near.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The chapel was built, the roads were broomed. He took his things, and went back home, not knowing of his early near-doom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 22</a><div class="page-content">And so, with glory and pride I wrote this book, so it won't be forgotten what effort it took - To build that chapel, roads and what else. But don't worry my friends, and fasten your belts. My deeds are far from done, there's work to be done.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Even if this book's contents are now far away gone.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Fin.</div></div>
