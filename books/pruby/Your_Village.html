<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Thank you for purchasing your brand new kitset village! In this kit you will find all you need to create a rustic town, or perhaps a modern apartment.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Your kit includes:
* 4 villager eggs
* 3 stacks of wood
* 12 stacks of stone
* this guide.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Why four eggs?

Many villages are started by buying a single pair of eggs. However, this creates undue pressure to get it perfect, and creates a period of risk and pressure. We provide two eggs to start, and two eggs to vault as a backup.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Villager breeding

Villagers will breed as long as there are two adults and the population is beneath the cap. The cap is just over one adult per three doors, so a 15 door village will support 5 villagers. Only correctly placed wooden doors count.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The placement rules are:
* 5 blocks in front and behind the door are checked.
* The number of blocks with a clear line to the sky are counted.
* These numbers must be different in front of and behind the door.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">This means that you have to have at least one block open to the sky within 5 spaces in front of or behind the door, and at least one block with a roof over it on the other side.

Glass counts as fully transparent, so doesn't block the line to the sky.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Each door counts, but they can share indoor and outdoor spaces. This means that you can build a single house with many doors, and it will support multiple villagers.

Villagers breed by themselves given enough doors.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Golem Spawning

When enough villagers are in a village, iron golems will spawn. One will spawn for every 10 villagers, as long as there is an appropriate location and at least 20 doors.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Golems require a 4 block high space to spawn in. Lighting is irrelevant. They only spawn in a limited area around the village, and on pretty much the same level as the village centre.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Village centre and merging.

When a valid door is within 16 blocks of a villager they will recognise it and incorporate it in to the village, or start a new village if without one.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">The village centre is the average of the doors' positions. The village radius is the distance to the furthest door, or 32, whichever is larger. If villages overlap they may merge in to a single village.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">To maximise villager numbers you want lots of doors. To maximise golem spawning you want lots of villages, each with at least 10 villagers in it, separated by ~60 blocks to prevent merging.</div></div>
