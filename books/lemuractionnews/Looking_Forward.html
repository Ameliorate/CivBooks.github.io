<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">   I am a man of many worlds. I have seen so many minecraft servers rise and fall. From the sidelines, I have mourned dead servers since 2010.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Yet, here we are, Devoted in October, 2017. Here I am. I don't want to be on the sidelines any longer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">   The way that I see it, Devoted will ultimately be abandoned. The real question, therefore, is when will that happen?<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   True, in the end our stories on this server will be erased, but this existential problem means only one thing. We, the players, MUST</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">make the most out of this place and we have to do it immediately.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Returning to the question posed, Devoted will only die once every last player stops believing in it, Once every last player stops making the most out of it. This is why it is so crucial</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">that we enjoy Devoted to the utmost extent while it is still here. Why we must act so quickly!<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Ultimately it is up to the players to make their server lively and fun. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Now, maybe all this may seem obvious to you, but it is important to remember it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">   All the servers I've seen die in these last few years suffered from an acute lack of player motivation.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   All this said, I am not so blind as to propose that every player should be one-hundred percent involved at all times. This is preposterous.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps we could just strive for things which make people want to be involved. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">   We could strive for magnificent building projects, gatherings, friendly competition. We could move away from wars which are hostile to new players and castrate veterans.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">   I know that even if we try to do these things, that war will still happen and that Devoted will still die. At least then, it will diehaving been fully explored and realized.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">    <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   I know this has been rambly and all over the place, so I thank you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">for taking the time to read. As of the time of writing, we are in an era of great peace. I can only hope that it persists.<span class="fmt0"></span>
