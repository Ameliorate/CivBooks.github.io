I read my free book that was given for first time players, and ate my cookies. And that's all that is promised in this world. Some cookies, a bed, and a welcome book.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">    When realizing that nothing is protected, I spang at the opportunity to see what I could do.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">    First spawning in Mount Augusta, I soon learned about citadel and that blocks are <span class="fmt0">protected...to<span class="fmt0"> a point,<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">    So at first I didn't know what to do, I just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">started breaking blocks that were easy to get. Torches that weren't reinforced, glass blocks, simple stuff.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">    It was after those few torches that I wanted to meet some people and live with a nation, as read in the welcome book.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">    So I saw the first person on the <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">TAB<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto"> list and messaged someone named A_M_A_Z_E.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">   He was nice. Started talking to me about what the server has for plugins. We eventually started to voice chat so he wouldn't have to keep typing all of this new in-</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">    So I asked about nations, and what my options were. He started going down the list and naming nations he knew and nations he was apart of. Eventually I picked a nation named Vogelburg, out in -+<span class="fmt0"></span></span>

<span class="fmt0">    When I arrived, I had died multiple time and lost my welcome book.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">    Welcoming me to Vogelburg, Greenthing 518 was delighted in having me become a</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">    When we finished, we parted ways. Ultimately leaving me to my demise. And so, this is where the story truly starts...</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was about midday when I finnaly got my own plot of land. Greenthing518 was finishing up my boarder when I told him what I was going to do with the land.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">After that point, I started to make a secret underground bunker, just two layers below dirt. It was't viable for long term, but it was enough for now. So I started to build a cobblestone</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">    A few hours go by and I go back into town, but on the outskirts I find a giant hole with chests next to them. I saw them on my way there but they were locked at the time because I wasn't a citizen of Vogelburg. I figured this was the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">    Cobblestone, cobblestone, and more cobblestone. I expected it to be a large portion of the contents but not all of it. It wasn't until about the last chest that I found the item that would change the way</div></div>
