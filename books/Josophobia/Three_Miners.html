<span class="fmt0">The tale of a man and his two friends on a mining excavation with the hope of buying an Elytra.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It all began with the return of an old citizen in the city.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">A man by the name of acfuffy had returned after an uncountable time period of him being distant from the land. the man returned to see a city very different than the one he remembered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It was much bigger and flourished with homes and people to fill them, yet it was not the largest. It wasn't grand, wasn't collosal - but it was much bigger than the little hole in the ground he remembered his city as.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Once there, acfuffy heard of a new way of transportation - the "Elytra". It was a pair of purple wings one can carry on their back, and if you have fireworks, you'll reach the clouds in a blink. There was a catch, though.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The Elytras are very rare, and thus very valuable. Obtaining one would require the fee of 124 diamonds.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Once acfuffy has heard of the Elytra, and more importantly - of its price, he had a spark within him. One that gave birth to a scheme:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"We'll go to the earth's core and mine 124 diamonds! We will get an Elytra, go to the end, and obtain as many Elytras as we could ever hope for!" Said acfuffy with a mighty voice to his friends. And two have answered his call:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">One new to the world, with ambition towards a great future - It was I and none other, Josophobia. The other familiar with the land, coming from far away - the young spirited RedTourmaline. The three took a drink, and to the excavation they went.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">They took a rail that was dug deep within the earth, leading from their town to a pit far away, hidden from the surface. Once they arrived, they witnessed a collosal pit, great enough for a city to emerge within it. And with that, they dug.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">They dug, and dug, and dug, and dug day and night.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Every once in a while, they found valuables and treasures such as gold, gems, metals and more - but most of all, they found many diamonds buried in stone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">For every new diamond they found, their smile grew bigger and their heart more hopeful, and acfuffy and his friends could feel their dream coming true.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">However, things have taken a turn.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The trader that offered acfuffy an elytra for 124 diamonds has backed off from the deal, and the three were left with their dreams broken. However, they still came out quite well with plenty of diamonds to spare and the best of the earth's riches.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The three haven taken their leave back to town, and to this very day they occassionally visit the collosal pit to extract more diamonds.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Each of them looking back to the time they ventured together as the three miners.</div></div>
