This article contains advice on how to effectively maintain leadership, such as that of a clan. This advice is cold and pragmatic, disregarding ideological values, moral values and other wishful thoughts,</div></div>

This is not an ethics discussion, as ethics are so highly subjective it is foolish to even consider using</div></div>

This is inspired by the works of Machiavelli and Sun Tzu, both who valued pragmatism over honour and integrity. Both of their works should be studied by anyone who wants to</div></div>

The Art of War by Sun Tzu, however, is more geared towards the more overt times of early civilization, when the concept of espionage was in its developing stages; he is however one of the early birds of such effective</div></div>

It is unwise to do good without reason, but it is more unwise to do evil if the populace will perceive it as so; when you must do evil, do it in secrecy. Do not ever stick to a set of principles or morality, you must take the action that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">has the most favourable consequences for you, in both the short and long term. The only thing that matters is your own survival, and survival is best guarded by maximizing your power and influence over others, so</div></div>

It is unwise to let yourself fall into the delusional and utopian morality of the meek, as you will only be trampled on, scorned by men</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content">and praised only by god. However, neither shall you ever be wanting to fall into the short-sighted immorality of the brute, as you will only incite the slaves into rebellion, scorned both by men and god. In order to succeed, you must not follow any</div></div>

Judge things not by their intent nor conduct, but by their consequences;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">however, do not judge people nor hold grudges against those who wrong you as this can create an exploitable bias within your psyche.
Aggression is justified whenever a cost-benefit analysis shows that you will gain more in the short and long</div></div>

If there is a state of nature that minimizes overt aggression, then use covert aggression and use it without mercy. Do not ever restrain aggression solely on principals or morals, only show restraint</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content">when cold calculation deduces that restraint will give preferable consequences to not restraining oneself. There are no such things as neutral parties, as all parties must compete with you for survival. That is to say, all parties that do not</div></div>

It is better to be feared than loved, but if and only if you cannot be both. It is always perilous to be hated by your</div></div>

However, even more powerful than fear, is covert power; as you will not be subject to the consequences of exercising it, and your enemies will severely underestimate</div></div>

You should never assign trust to men without justification for doing so, but feigning trust is important to obtaining their cooperation. When you have suspicions without backing evidence,</div></div>

Always ensure the people have a need for you; that is, do not prevent problems if the prevention does not have consequences preferable to fixing the problem once it occurs. If you act as a nanny, the populace will hold you in</div></div>

When choosing a course of action, always value cost-benefit over simplicity. Typically this means that all</div></div>

The use of overt force against enemies to achieve objectives often incurs political repercussions that more than negate its initial gains; it may</div></div>

What you must fight for is to safeguard your existence and the survival of your leadership and the sustenance of your power.</div></div>
