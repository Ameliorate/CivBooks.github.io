<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">My name is Soulfur. I live in a town near the center of the map called Kazad Ankor.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">When I first came to this place, I saw the dilapidated farm of wheat and some potatoes. A food shortage was present.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">As any helpful citizen should, I met the demand by building a cottage and tending to the crops.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I care for nothing but planting and harvesting the fruits of roots and grasses, and smashing the melons which sustain us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The only other "civ" server on which I have played was Civcraft 3.0. I was excited for its release. I played for a while and lost interest towards the end of its lifespawn.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">So frequently I noticed the same trend:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Those who are ambitious and seek great things... frequently fall, and always have a bad time.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Why not be like me, and enjoy the peaceful existence of a task that one knows helps those around him?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I enjoy the gardens because for each block broken, and for each seed sown, one fragment of happiness is added to the group.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Indeed, all that must be done to "win" this game is the farming of these crops. Do not seek war, leadership, or political strife.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Please, for your own sake, join me in my laborious efforts.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Farm, mine, woodcut, fish, build... simply specialize.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Play not too much or too seriously or this will become a boredom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">If the game is treated as a fun social setting, and you are respectful to those around you, and of course you enjoy the "menial labor," you will know the sheer fun that can be had just from breaking or placing a few blocks.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">That is Minecraft, imo.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Regarding trade -<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I have a ridiculous surplus of baked potatoes. A double chest, easily.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The same can be said for my wheat (hay bale) supply. And the carrots. Oh, the melons as well. Soon, sugar cane.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It is not my role as I am a simple farmer. As of this writing I own a shop in Mount Athos that sells crops, but more must work:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">All must work to promote free and easy trade. I should not have a surplus of crops. Other need them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It is difficult, and at the moment apparently impossible, to find a source through which I can peddle my edible products.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">To summarize:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Work hard.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Promote trade.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Thank you.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
