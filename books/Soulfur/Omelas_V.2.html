<span class="fmt0">If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and comfrted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">and delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed. Those are the terms. To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life in Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of happiness of one: that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen the child and faced this</div></div>

But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released, it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague pleasure of warmth and food, no doubt, but little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">more. It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy. It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it</div></div>

Their tears at the bitter injustice dry when they begin to perceive the terrible justice of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. They know that they, like the child, are not free. They know compassion. It is the</div></div>

It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. They</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">know that if the wretched one were not there snivelling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make no joyful music as the young riders line up their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first morning of summer.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go to see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home</div></div>

Each one goes alone, youth or girl man or woman. Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow-lit windows, and on out into the darkness of the fields.</div></div>

They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back. The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to must of us than the city of happiness.</div></div>
