This is no different for Lastarchon, as he, as I, fell victim to it several times on my initial travels through these lands. My initial destonation was Fellowship, an old</div></div>

Through many deaths and very few friends I finally arrived at Fellowship. It was not what I expected. I was quick not to trust the town and decided to live in the hills, and I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 24</a><div class="page-content">mean IN the hills. So, meeting up with my friend Pas976 we dug out and reinforced a large complex in the hillside looking over the Fellowship camp. Through our days there we heard of a communist order in Fellowship. We had found new friends.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 24</a><div class="page-content">   Once again hunger strikes and I, once again, have to move around the world through death. On my way back to Fellowship I overhear two bloaks chatting about a new town. I watch their conversation, nibbling on some bread I had snatched from a small feild</div></div>

And the words "Communist Utopia" come up. I jut into the conversation and, as I do, quickly get the coordinates of this new town. Mootropolis (That I totally came up with the name of, Blank >.<) I built a small cobble shack and my</div></div>

Through the next days I didn't do much other then just wonder around. Until one day I decided I need to build some kind of structure around my farm to protect it. This is when the fun starts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Through my wood and cobble gazebo I earned the praise of my comrades, more than I could have asked for. I then continued to build more, expanding roads, creating a park, and started to design a large city centre. Prosperity for all!</div></div>

Some time during one of my frequent breaks the original pair, BlankSynergy and btingle, had found a new friend. This new friend was not someone we wanted. So, from the ashes of Mootropolis...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">We left. Together we moved south through the lag-infested jungles and oceans until we reached this island. Flat enough for expansion and isolated enough for protection, it was perfect for us.    I quickly got to work on the first building, starting with</div></div>

Adding a few blocks here and there afterwords, I once again did nothing. I saw that there was a need. The city needed terraforming if it was to grow. I was alone in this venture. Dispite asking for help, I was unable</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">to even get sticks for shovels from my comrades. But I stayed on. Stopped by these same comrades to fetch logs, or get food, or help plant wheat, I still continued my work on the terraformation of Newtro. *Newtro is a combination of New Mootropolis*</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">-once again, I'm sure someone else took credit for this.) Next were the roads. I had to plan out an entire city, give room for further expansion if needed, and attempt to make it look good in the process. With the teir approach I went with the roads were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">quite easy to lay out, two large rings with one road branching from the farthest endges upwards to meet in the middle. The staircase design of the roads make it difficult, and expensive, to create. With the help of another lad, Monofone, I was able to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">have a constant supply of materials to create the roads. At this point I had been working for close to a week logging no less then three hours each day, during school, with seven hours the final day (saturday) On this final day, and the sunday afterword..</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">I encased each teir in stone bricks. I then turned to the farm. During this time of building the farm, I'm not sure by whom, I assume it was a group efford, had expanded to an obsurd size. So monofone, in his good nature, had attempted to improve the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">effieciency of the farm by creating a stone grid throughout the farm. I decided I had a better idea. With monofone's help I was able to harvest the farm, create a teird platform above it, hoe and saturate said platform, and re-plant the crops.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Next came the hard part. The teird farm was designed to use water flow to harvest the crops and, as it was, it couldn't do that. We didn't have enough pistons to automate the entire thing. So, through another two hours of work I was able to design and...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">build the current system, one piston flooding the entire feild. I then attached a switch to said piston and, to monofone's amazement I was able to harvest the entire feild in just under three minutes, though replanting was another story.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">The next important thing I did, after pausing the road construction to create the farm, was create a crafting area suited for the city I had in mind. A wall of furnaces to rival the greatest empires, combined with the automation of the hoppers that were..</div></div>

Our creations rival your own!" And this is what I built.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">   It is then when I decided I needed a break from minecraft for a while. What I didn't intend was, when I checked back in a few days later, there were several new members to the city. So, at BlankSynergy's request, I started working on a tenement.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">It was then when I finally got bored of it. I was tired from building an entire city, from field to glory, and creating a sustainable source of income, from using the weakest tools of an entire city to do the largest jobs. Of having my gold helm insulted.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 24</a><div class="page-content">I grew tired of Civcraft. I grew tired of Newtro. 

And so I left.</div></div>

-I also intend to finish the tenements, maybe)
