<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Long ago, in 1.0, New Agora had but one main enemy: Mandy. Mandy was the leader of a terrorist cell named the Alkaowni.

This group</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">terrorized New Agora by placing multiple stacks of DRO grief throughout the city in a matter of a few hours.

New Agora spent three days camping the logout of Mandy until Mandy finally logged in and was pearled by farley50.</div></div>

The Alkaowni played nice for a few weeks and even helped build a vault and sell exp.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Finally, one day the Alkaowni griefed Aurora with over 7 stacks of DRO; an attack so devastating that it singlehandedly brought about the creation of the Acid Block.

After a month of work, the DRO was gone and Aurora moved on.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Around the time of the conception of the South District, three new players came and settled in Aurora: Hummelwagen, SexyBunny, and Mirandasquish.

These three also began construction</div></div>

This resulted in a long winded dispute in which members of the co-op were pearled, causing tension between Bryn and Aurora. Finally, the co-op members were released and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">eventually all involved became friends.

<span class="fmt1"><span class="fmtcode">§1</span>The Old Guard Exodus

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Also around this time something interesting began to happen. The 1.0 New Agorans (commonly referred to as the 'Old Guard') who planned and founded the city of Aurora</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">began to butt heads with new players that were starting to take on bigger roles throughout the city. 

Plot disagreements and arguments about the inefficiency of the government quickly created a fissure between most of the Old Guard and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Aurora's emerging leaders. This finally came to a head when a large group of the Old Agorans decided to leave the city.

Though this event was tragic, Aurora continued to grow and thrive in the coming months.</div></div>

Around this time, many</div></div>

Pop Culture

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Upon learning the amount of breaks a single piece of DRO requires, an Auroran citizen proclaimed "1800?! JESUS". This phrase became well known throughout the</div></div>

During the Mirango Incident, signs were placed to claim territory much to the disapproval of Bryn. In response, Brynian citizens acquired a plot within Aurora and proceeded to place "Sign is God" signs all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">over the plot. The "Sign is God" meme eventually became a religion as well. 

The Owluminati were responsible for building the Auroran National park. There have been many rumors of hidden rooms and even a full-sized Inn hidden</div></div>
