When I set out to chronicle the history of Samarra, I struggled to find the appropriate medium to express it in a way that resembled the way I feel about the city'sïœƒ</div></div>

I arrived on the server after some hesitation, knowing full well how easily I would get sucked into it.  I woke up in a strange place.  Great, I was in an ice mountains biome. I headed in a random direction until I stumbled on a cobble road.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">I followed the road to a large city. A sign read, "Welcome to Carbon."  I shouted out a hello, but to no avail.  The city seemed inactive.  I grabbed some wheat, replanted and moved along.  I found another road leading to a place called Mt. Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">As I neared Mt. Augusta, I got in range of someone's chat. "Salaam," said GTA.  Salaam? As an Arab, I was delighted to come across what I assumed to be another Arab on the server.  GTA was providing coordinates to someone named Soccer, another newfriend.</div></div>

GTA, who turned out to be the Sultan, provided Soccer and I with available plots and left us to our devices. I was excited to contribute to the overall theme of the city, especially after taking an Islamic "</div></div>

I got to work at creating my Istanbul home as I got to know Soccer, who ended up being my neighbor there. It became clear rather quickly that Soccer was seeking to establish himself monetarily on the server."</div></div>
