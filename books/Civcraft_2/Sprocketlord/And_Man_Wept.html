      And Man Wept

Snap!


Man huddled around
a crackling fire. In the trees, Man could hear a twig break.

A faint rustling came from the clearings edge.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
Man sat huddled around a dying fire.

The shadow god hid from the terrible beasts on this night.

Man could hear them
in the trees. Their howl piercing the night like a spear.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
If the shadow god hid, how much more terrible the beasts must be. 

As the fire died, Man was cold.

Man shivered in the dark.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
The beasts were closer. Man could hear their growl. The shadow god was more fearful than man. 

The shadow god wept.

Man was wet with the tears.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
Man heard the beasts. 

Man knew his fate,
but was far from accepting.

Darkness seemed to be at it's peak.

The beasts closed in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
Man was fearful. Man held on to the last glimmer of hope.

And Man wept until that glimmer of hope became a light. And the light lit up the darkness. The beasts fled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
And the light became a beacon. And the beacon gave warmth to Man.

And the beacon shunned all darkness, which was exiled to the forest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
The beacon rose to the sky, and awoke the fire god. The fire god took the beacon, and put it in himself.

And the fire god became the light god.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
And even the cowardly shadow god could not hide from the light god. 
For the light god had children, and the children surrounded the shadow god so that he may never flee too far.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
And man rejoiced.

And man wept tears of joy. 

Man was warm and dry, and no longer under the threat of the beasts or the shadows.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">
Man sat around a fire, and all of Mankind listened to him tell this tale. 

And Mankind sat in wonder. For it lived...


....because man wept.</div></div>
