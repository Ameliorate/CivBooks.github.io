<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>  Following barbarous attacks on major settlements, SpaceJack decided to introduce a quasi-feudal system to Civcraftia.

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   The region surrounding 1435,4422 became the center of the feudal system in it's early days.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">   The rules of this feudal society gave structure to the society, a clear hierarchy. Lords protected vassals, vassals supported their lords. Everyone had obligations and everyone had duties. However, in Civcraftia support is easily achieved.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">There is much room for economic freedom, self expression, and self determinism. 

   But there are infrequent raids, griefers, and nomadic interlopers. When they attack there must be an overwhelmingly orderly response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">   For this reason, the following societal compact is made:

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> The Lord is responsible for military training and armored equipping of his vassals. He shall coordinate self defense exercises and provide limited economic assistance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>The Lord must have a fortified Hall capable of sleeping all his subjects. The Lord must also have stockpiles of food, weapons, and useful beasts. The Lord must ultimatlely protect and provide for his vassals.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> The Lord can grant fiefs to his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>loyal burghers, knights, and clerics.

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Burghers are encamped storekeepers loyal first to their Lord. They owe one in twenty of of their income to their Lord in exchange for protection of their wares and lives. In times of crisis they may be called</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>upon to share their wares with other vassals. After such times, the Lord is responsible for the repayment of any debt incurred during that period. 

  Knights come in three varieties, all of which serve the lord and keep his peace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>  First are the Household Knights, which serve the Lord in his household in exchange for economic support. Their training is supported by the Lord.

  Second are the Landed Knights. These Knights have been granted fiefs of their own.</div></div>

They are responsible for their own training, and owe one in fourty of their income to their Lord as well as guarunteed military service should they be called upon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">  <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>The third variety of Knight are the Wandering Knights, who serve the lord in times of war, but otherwise have no obligation to him. They are responsible for their own training and equiptment and are largely independent. They may not own Land, however.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> Lastly of the Lord's subjects are the Clerics, who owe him no service in times of war, but owe him their allegiance and support. They are responsible for chronicling the Lord's realm, keeping accounts of his incomes, and distributing vassals' taxes.</div></div>
