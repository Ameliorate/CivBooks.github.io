<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content"> I first arrived in Avernum while punching a spider to death. The creature had watched me beat wood out of a tree, and still thought that I would make a tasty meal.

I was approached by a resident, nuvasuper, who asked some curious questions about</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">my political i deology and beliefs about sharing. I considered quoting the Sage:

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>"When taxes are too high, people go hungry. When the government is too intrustive, people lose their spirit. Act for the peoples benefit, trust them, leave them alone."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"But, considering men in this strange land might not follow the way, or might even take the ramblings of the drunken maniac we call the Sage seriously, Heaven knowing they seemed to take everything else seriously, I thought better of it. Where was I? "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Oh, yes. He invited me in, and I accepted.

The City itself is cunningly hidden - 
In a way I cannot disclose. But trust me, it's very clever. Upon entering the city proper, I gasped with astonishment at the sight. A vast, orderly array of houses</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">swept away into the distance. I was introduced to the mines, and my own plot of land where I might build. The people were friendly, if a little paranoid - the whole city was designed around the goal of avoiding attack by a group called "Griefers."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The residents hadn't heard of <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>The Way</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>, but the self-sufficiency, generosity, and simplicity spirit they displayed showed that they lived it well enough.

<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>This city follows only four rules:

I. Respect people's property and Livestock.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> II. Communal assets must be shared.

III. Follow the Building Code.

IV. Don't be a dick.

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Fantastically simple, isn't it? Personally I would go with just the fourth rule, but to each their own. The philosophy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">that governs them is "panarchism" - the idea that multiple competing idealologies should live within the same space. Thus, there are anarcho capitalists and libertarian socialists and communists and even myself, a humble follower of the way. All living</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"cheek by jowl, striving not to be dicks to eachother. They are far removed from the petty political and idealogical differences which seperate their brethren in such distant lands as Panneton and Columbia, and seem much more focused on being pleasant to"</div></div>

I think I like it here, but I wonder what other towns are out there...
