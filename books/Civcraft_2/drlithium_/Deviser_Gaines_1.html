<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Originally from Medriaas City, the bustling intellectual center of Ruxomar, the young and ambitious boy named Finch Gaines would fit in well with the natural philosophers and genius engineers native to the city."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Finch would be heavily pressured on a daily basis to meet high academic standards by his strict father, who only accepted perfect intellectual performance."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The taxation would pay off in time, and at the age of only 16 Finch would be granted scholarship to Summerhold College - the most prestigious in all of Ruxomar."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"However, his father\u0027s high expectations would come at a price. After enrolling into Summerhold, Finch vowed to one day exact revenge on his father in the most sadistic way possible. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"y the time the sadistic raiders working on behalf of the Kokushi Empire began to worm their way into Ruxomar, Gaines had graduated from Summerhold as the highest performing student the College had ever seen"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"and had begun to work as an experimental weapons tinkerer within the Engineering branch of the United Military of Ruxomar (but not before ensuring the tragic disappearance of his deeply jealous father)."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Gaines, now a five star military engineer after only one year of service within the military, would be among the elite few to be drafted into "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"the Council of Devisers, a secret corps of the greatest military minds in Ruxomar formed in response to the Kokushi invasion. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Gaines and an exclusive team of like-minded scientists and engineers would be tasked with developing an extensive lineup of lethal experimental"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"weapons designed to end the war with the primary goal of finding a way to exploit the Emperor\u0027s weaknesses and theorize a method to assassinating him and ending the Kokushi\u0027s threat. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The newly christened Deviser Gaines worked dilligently in service of Ruxomar and proved to be one of the military\u0027s greatest assets. However, his motives, which remained his own, had little to do with the outcome of the war."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Gaines masked his heinous and inhumane experiments as the development of new weapon prototypes, and his superiors were none the wiser."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"During his time as the military\u0027s greatest Deviser, Gaines would develop an even greater understanding of natural science; and not only its effects on the human anatomy, but also how its nature was intertwined with that of magic. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">" By conducting a series of experiments on subjects deemed to be supernatural, Gaines concluded that their powers were not divine, but indeed scientific in nature. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The next year for Deviser Gaines would be spent steeped in endless research, development, and experimentation."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">After finally devising a "formula," as he put it for supernatural prowess, Gaines set about testing his theory on himself by constructing a device that, if his calculations were correct,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"would allow him to harness a magnitude of supernatural power equal to that of the Kokushi Emperor. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"On the eve of his greatest discovery, though, the Kokushi had begun their relentless invasion on Medriaas City, and the Council of Devisers HQ was caught directly in the raiders\u0027 path of destruction. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"However, Medriaas was a heavily fortified city and could likely withstand bombardment for several weeks."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Despite its fortification, though, no city could withstand a Kokushi onslaught forever."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"As the Empire grew restless, they realized they needed someone on the inside to turn the tide for them. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"When the Emperor\u0027s Butcher, Lithium, came to Deviser Gaines offering a position as the Emperor\u0027s top engineer and scientist and unconditional free scientific reign over the Empire, the ambitious engineer couldn\u0027t refuse."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"There was only one condition to the offer: Gaines had to betray the Council of Devisers and Ruxomar as a whole by sabotaging the city\u0027s defenses and allowing the Kokushi onslaught to continue. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Having no love for any of his peers, Gaines hardly saw it as a drawback at all. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Now under the Emperor\u0027s command but nontheless free to continue his experiments uninhibited, Deviser Gaines continued his research into developing ways to harness ulimited supernatural power. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Within a week, Gaines had completed the prototype for a chip-like device implanted on to his back to grant substantial magical power through a complex system of mathematical equations."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Indeed, the device worked magnificently, though at a slight cost to his overall sanity. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Obsessed with his newfound power, Gaines continued developing new cybernetic implants and enhancements and subsequently fitting them to himself to enhance his power."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Approximately five years after being volunatarily conscripted into the Emperor\u0027s service, Gaines embarked on a journey to the developing continent of Sivistys, a sister landmass of the much larger Ruxomar."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Sivistys was a young land and was no stranger to great powerplays."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">" Even to the present day, the numerous countries and empires operating within Sivistys are under constant fire from their neighbors and wandering raiders from across the land. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">hat brought Gaines to Sivistys had little to do with politics, however. Over the years, Gaines had been developing a machine used to trace levels of an energy that he dubbed "Quintessence,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"an invisible form of matter that theoretically made up a vast majority of space, and, while plentiful, was spread incredibly thin."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> Gaines believed that, if he could effectively harvest the energy by excavating it in "hot spots," he could repurpose it and use its properties to warp reality.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The extent of the energy\u0027s abilities were unknown to him at the time, though Gaines was nothing if not curious. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"As it happened, one of these theoretical pockets of Quintessence had been located in Sivistys, deep in the eastern quadrant of the continent and a week\u0027s trip from the closest major city of Mount Augusta. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"As he approached the energy hotspot, just as he suspected, readings of the matter had begun to spike, and within several hundred miles of the hotspot he set up a temporary shelter to erect his mobile laboratory. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Using only a miniature Quintessence Device and two Potions of Healing, Gaines procured one solitary milliliter of a liquified form of the energy. To finally put his theory to the test,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Gaines concentrated a beam of superheated Blaze Powder on the liquid and added in one atom of harvested Emerald Ore. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">" Instantly, the lab began to emanate pure Quintessence Energy, and every block the lab had been comprised of had been converted"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"into Blocks of Emerald, with Gaines only saving his vital lab equipment at the last second. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Gaines salvaged as much of the Emeralds as he could, noting that even a few ounces of the ore could be sold for hundreds of diamonds."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"By taming a herd of wild horses, Gaines had once again mobilized his laboratory and headed towards the Quintessence pocket at full speed. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Only a day later, Gaines arrived at the hotspot, only to immediately be halted by what he presumed to be a poor farmer dressed in rags and wielding a pitchfork made of coarse dirt and animal droppings."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The hotspot, as Gaines had observed, had appeared to be a barren wasteland, completely devoid of all natural resources and "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"fertile soil with numerous lakes of molten rock and pits of soul sand scarring the vast landscape. Obviously, the Quintessence had something to do with the Nether dimension, though Gaines could only speculate the implications. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"The farmer had evidently attempted to turn a profit off the land by making numerous efforts to cultivate the infertile soil and raise cattle, though all the efforts had been in vain."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"In the farmer\u0027s voice, Gaines gathered a distinct Ruxomarian accent - indeed, several hundred years ago, scores of Ruxomarian merchants and explorers had pioneered the land of Sivistys, and their descendents"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">" now populated the developing continent. Given the farmer\u0027s location, he was likely the descendant of a Ruxomarian pioneer hoping to turn a profit off the new land."</div></div>
