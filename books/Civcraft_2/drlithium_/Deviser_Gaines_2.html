The farmer, who called himself Andrew Mallace, demanded a tax of 64 Iron Ingots from Gaines for his trespassing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">To the farmer's surprise, however, the traveling scientist wanted much more than to traverse the land, and offered six ounces of Emerald Ore to buy the entire island.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Instantly overwhelmed with the thought of becoming a millionaire, Mallace grabbed the Emerald and immediately packed his things and headed west towards Mount Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Now with the Quintessence pocket secured, Gaines began to harvest the energy and store it in tiny vials kept on his belt at all times. Within a few days, upwards of decillions of joules</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">of Quintessence had been condensed and stored in five miniature glass vials.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">And almost as quickly as the energy had been completely harvested, the land began to transition into something reminiscent of the rest of Sivistys;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content"> the netherrack turned into luscious fertile soil, the soul sand became mud, and the lava rippled into water form.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Having everything he needed, Gaines left Sivistys and made a beeline back to the heart the land once known as Ertdor - the heart of the Kokushi Empire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The Emperor of the Kokushi expressed a distinct interest in Gaines' new discoveries - particularly the phenomenon in which a Nether Biome would be formed when large amounts of Quintessence Energy was focused on one spot.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The Emperor, completely oblivious of all other possible applications of the energy, ordered Gaines to begin prototyping a device that could be used to weaponize Quintessence and quickly convert large quantities of land into Nether Matter.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Gaines would create the first prototype for the device six months later, dubbing it "The Slip Device." However, in truth, Gaines did not share The Emperor's interest in weaponizing the energy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">The Deviser would begin stockpiling massive amounts of the energy over the next few years in secret, with The Emperor none the wiser the entire time.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Though the Kokushi Empire is but a distant memory now, legend has it Gaines still operates somewhere in the outskirts of Sivistys.</div></div>
