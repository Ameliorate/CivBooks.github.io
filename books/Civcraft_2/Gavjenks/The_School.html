       The School

<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Well, we had all these children out planting trees, see, because we figured that ... that was part of their education, to see how, you know, the root systems ... and also the sense of responsibility, taking care of things, being individually responsible.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 38</a><div class="page-content">You know what I mean. And the trees all died. They were orange trees. I don’t know why they died, they just died. Something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn’t the best. We complained about it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 38</a><div class="page-content">So we’ve got thirty kids there, each kid had his or her own little tree to plant and we’ve got these thirty dead trees. All these kids looking at these little brown sticks, it was depressing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 38</a><div class="page-content">It wouldn’t have been so bad except that just a couple of weeks before the thing with the trees, the snakes all died. But I think that the snakes --</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 38</a><div class="page-content">well, the reason that the snakes kicked off was that ... you remember, the boiler was shut off for four days because of the strike, and that was explicable.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 38</a><div class="page-content">It was something you could explain to the kids because of the strike. I mean, none of their parents would let them cross the picket line and they knew there was a strike going on and what it meant.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 38</a><div class="page-content">So when things got started up again and we found the snakes they weren’t too disturbed.

With the herb gardens it was probably a case of overwatering, and at least now they know not to overwater.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The children were very conscientious with the herb gardens and some of them probably ... you know, slipped them a little extra water when we weren’t looking. Or maybe ... well, I don’t like to think about sabotage, although it did occur to us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I mean, it was something that crossed our minds. We were thinking that way probably because before that the gerbils had died, and the white mice had died, and the salamander ... well, now they know not to carry them around in plastic bags.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Of course we expected the tropical fish to die, that was no surprise. Those numbers, you look at them crooked and they’re belly-up on the surface.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 38</a><div class="page-content">But the lesson plan called for a tropical fish input at that point, there was nothing we could do, it happens every year, you just have to hurry past it.

We weren’t even supposed to have a puppy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 38</a><div class="page-content">We weren’t even supposed to have one, it was just a puppy the Murdoch girl found under a Gristede’s truck one day and she was afraid the truck would run over it when the driver had finished making his delivery,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 38</a><div class="page-content">so she stuck it in her knapsack and brought it to the school with her. So we had this puppy. As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will live for about two weeks and then...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And that’s what it did. It wasn’t supposed to be in the classroom at all, there’s some kind of regulation about it,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 38</a><div class="page-content">but you can’t tell them they can’t have a puppy when the puppy is already there, right in front of them, running around on the floor and yap yap yapping.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 38</a><div class="page-content">They named it Edgar – that is, they named it after me. They had a lot of fun running after it and yelling, “Here, Edgar! Nice Edgar!” Then they’d laugh like hell. They enjoyed the ambiguity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I enjoyed it myself. I don’t mind being kidded. They made a little house for it in the supply closet and all that. I don’t know what it died of. Distemper, I guess. It probably hadn’t had any shots.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I got it out of there before the kids got to school. I checked the supply closet each morning, routinely, because I knew what was going to happen. I gave it to the custodian.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And then there was this Korean orphan that the class adopted through the Help the Children program, all the kids brought in a quarter a month, that was the idea.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 38</a><div class="page-content">It was an unfortunate thing, the kid’s name was Kim and maybe we adopted him too late or something.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The cause of death was not stated in the letter we got, they suggested we adopt another child instead and sent us some interesting case histories, but we didn’t have the heart.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The class took it pretty hard, they began (I think, nobody ever said anything to me directly) to feel that maybe there was something wrong with the school.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 38</a><div class="page-content">But I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the school, particularly, I’ve seen better and I’ve seen worse. It was just a run of bad luck. We had an extraordinary number of parents passing away, for instance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 38</a><div class="page-content">There were I think two heart attacks and two suicides, one drowning, and four killed together in a car accident. One stroke.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And we had the usual heavy mortality rate among the grandparents, or maybe it was heavier this year, it seemed so. And finally the tragedy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The tragedy occurred when Matthew Wein and Tony Mavrogordo were playing over where they’re excavating for the new federal office building.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 38</a><div class="page-content">There were all these big wooden beams stacked, you know, at the edge of the excavation. There’s a court case coming out of that, the parents are claiming that the beams were poorly stacked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I don’t know what’s true and what’s not. It’s been a strange year.

I forgot to mention Billy Brandt’s father who was knifed fatally when he grappled with a masked intruder in his home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 38</a><div class="page-content">One day, we had a discussion in class. They asked me, where did they go? The trees, the salamander, the tropical fish, Edgar, the poppas and mommas, Matthew and Tony, where did they go?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 38</a><div class="page-content">And I said, I don’t know, I don’t know. And they said, who knows? and I said, nobody knows. And they said, is death that which gives meaning to life? And I said no, life is that which gives meaning to life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Then they said, but isn’t death, considered as a fundamental datum, the means by which the taken-for-granted mundanity of the everyday may be transcended in the direction of –</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I said, yes, maybe. 

They said, we don’t like it. 

I said, that’s sound. 

They said, it’s a bloody shame! 

I said, it is.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 38</a><div class="page-content">They said, will you make love now with Helen (our teaching assistant) so that we can see how it is done? We know you like Helen. 

I do like Helen but I said that I would not. 
We’ve heard so much about it, they said, but we’ve never seen it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I said I would be fired and that it was never, or almost never, done as a demonstration. Helen looked out the window. 

They said, please, please make love with Helen, we require an assertion of value, we are frightened.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I said that they shouldn’t be frightened (although I am often frightened) and that there was value everywhere. Helen came and embraced me. I kissed her a few times on the brow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 38</a><div class="page-content">We held each other. The children were excited. Then there was a knock on the door, I opened the door, and the new gerbil walked in. The children cheered wildly.</div></div>
