 The Tell-Tale Heart
            by
   Edgar Allan Poe

        
    Volume 1 of 2</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 31</a><div class="page-content">TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?

The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 31</a><div class="page-content">It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 31</a><div class="page-content">He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 31</a><div class="page-content">His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?"

I kept quite still and said nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 31</a><div class="page-content">For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 31</a><div class="page-content">He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 31</a><div class="page-content">And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 31</a><div class="page-content">When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 31</a><div class="page-content">--until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.

It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 31</a><div class="page-content">but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 31</a><div class="page-content">
