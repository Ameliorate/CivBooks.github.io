<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Once upon a time, there was a person called Mandy. One day, Mandy griefed, and griefed. "Wow," said Mandy, "I sure have done a lot of griefing, haven't I?"

Everyone else agreed, and they set out to capture the griefer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Mandy ran, and the hunters followed; Mandy ran, and the hunters followed; MANDY RAN, and STILL the hunters followed. Mandy ran and ran but could not run any more! The hunters finally captured poor Mandy and put the pearl into a BIG vault.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Mandy didn't like being captured; Mandy much preferred to grief instead. "How can I grief when I am captured?" thought Mandy. "I know! I'll build a big mall that everyone will love. They'll have to let me out then!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 7</a><div class="page-content">So then Mandy started digging, and digging, and digging.

"Good golly, what's this?" questioned people when they arrived in the End.

Mandy then explained the plan, and the people in the End loved it and decided to help.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Mandy's new End friends sure made the job easier. They discovered how to explode beds, they donated tools, and they even dug endstone alongside Mandy!

In no time at all, the mall was finished.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 7</a><div class="page-content">There was no more endstone to dig, and Mandy's job was done.

Everyone loved the mall, and they all lived happily ever after in...

The End.</div></div>
