 The Tell-Tale Heart
            by
   Edgar Allan Poe


    Volume 2 of 2</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 32</a><div class="page-content">And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.

But even yet I refrained and kept still.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had come!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.

I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing wrong.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 32</a><div class="page-content">There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.

I smiled, --for what had I to fear?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well.

I led them, at length, to his chamber.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 32</a><div class="page-content">while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 32</a><div class="page-content">And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 32</a><div class="page-content">this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 32</a><div class="page-content">"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is the beating of his hideous heart!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
