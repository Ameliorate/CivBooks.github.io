    ECONOMIC MODEL

<span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Reflecting the essence of New Danzilona, Weishaar's Economic Model provides a unique, if not controversial, mix of capitalism and government oversight that has been the theoretical backbone</div></div>

Under the direction of Weishaar, Danzmarket has become the first successful market in the Danzilonan Federation. Now popularly recognized by even the most traditional of</div></div>

W.E.T. thrives only with a well-intented and very active leader. The title of the leader behind a market running under W.E.T. is "Lorax." This term harkens to the ideals of good-naturedness, stewardship, and community. Ideals</div></div>

The pace at which the market has grown is uncomparable to that of other marketplaces; instead of relying on foreign investment and people to naturally gain interest in becoming a merchant, the Lorax is responsible for finding and filling</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>positions called "niches" in the market place. Niches are categories of items that are related in some way. The Lorax is responsible for handing out the authority to sell niche items to merchants. For example, a baker could only sell food-related items</div></div>

<span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Niching allows the Lorax to promote specialization among merchants and to stop the rise of general stores. Though this may sound like</div></div>

Under W.E.T., niching provides the Lorax</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>with a method of ensuring lower unemployment rates in the host city than any other system while still adhering to the ideology of capitalism. Niching is an effective tool to allow the maximum participation of old and newfriends in the capitalist arena.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Whereas in laissez-faire economies, large corporations tend to swallow up multiple industries and undercutting smaller operations, W.E.T. passively prevents many economic power blocks from forming by pigeon-holing more ruthless merchants</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>thereby giving opportunities and space in the market for newcomers to the economic sphere that they otherwise might not get.

Specializing in certain niching also gives the Lorax a soft-power that is often lost by other market heads:</div></div>

Every merchant in Danzmarket builds an esprit-de-corp with eachother that replaces the competitive, aggressive nature that is common in other circles. Under Weishaar's Economic Theory, there are no "general merchants,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>there are Leathermen, miners, pub-owners, and Nethermen. The unique nature of a merchant's job choice fuels them with pride to continue. Inclusiveness and Identity are the centers of gravity that bind markets over time.</div></div>

ECONOMIC THEORY

<span class="fmt8"><span class="fmtcode">§8</span>Under W.E.T., the trade district is built shop-by-shop solely by the Lorax. Once a merchant requests and is approved entry into the marketplace, the Lorax will ask them for any desired designs, materials, or</div></div>

The Lorax will finish the new build in a timely manner and will inform the selected merchant once the shop is ready to receive its wares. Once moved in, the merchant is responsible to the Lorax,</div></div>
