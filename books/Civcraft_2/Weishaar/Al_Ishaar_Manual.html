All are welcome now and forever more.

<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Al Ishaar is the second trade district to be built and administrated by Weishaar. The first being Danzmarket, but that's a story unto itself....

Al Ishaar exists under the tenets of free enterprise and controlled "pruning."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Though Weishaar has built every shop building in Al Ishaar, use of these facilities come at no charge for prospective merchants. The only stipulation to join the market is that the buildings and rights to sell within the district are retained by Weishaar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 29</a><div class="page-content">This affords the Trade Administrator the right to evict merchants. This only has been exercised for two reasons:

1. The Merchant is convicted of a serious crime; and/or
2. The Merchant fails to maintain adequate stocks reliably.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 29</a><div class="page-content">The intent of Al Ishaar is to provide meaningful goals to the citizens of Mount Augusta, to provide the opportunity for new merchants to engage in trade, and to give citizens an interesting new way of earning wealth in a communal setting.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Can you join the Al Ishaar Trade District?

Yes. All Civcrafters have the opportunity to operate a business in Al Ishaar provided that they can prove that they are not (or no longer) engaged in serious crime. If you are new, experienced, Augustan or not!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 29</a><div class="page-content">How do I join Al Ishaar?

Contact weishaar in-game or /u/anthologeas on reddit! He will ask you a few questions to make sure that you understand the local market environment and that you are ready to join!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 29</a><div class="page-content">What happens if I'm gone for awhile?

If you do not leave Weishaar a note explaining when you are due to return and restock, Weishaar will attempt to contact you in-game/ on reddit. If this fails, a notice of "Administrative Review" will be posted at the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 29</a><div class="page-content">door. This notice will state a date that is 7 days in the future of the placement of the sign. If nothing is heard from the merchant by that time, the shop will be cleared and prepped for a fresh merchant. Al Ishaar is not liable for any loss.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 29</a><div class="page-content">This sounds mighty judicial... 

To keep us in business as a community, we need these fall backs. That being said, most all activity in Al Ishaar is exercised in good faith and understanding. We want a vibrant community!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 29</a><div class="page-content">What can I sell?

You can sell and buy anything you like within your shop. Anything you intend to sell must be reliably stocked. It is recommended that you specialize in specific items and/or services to ensure that you gain trusting, happy customers and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 29</a><div class="page-content">to maximize your earning potential. You can stock a range of items however experience has shown that name-brand goods bring the boys to the yard.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 29</a><div class="page-content">If you have anyother questions, feel free to ask! 

Welcome to Al Ishaar,
the Free Market.

NOTE: THE REMAINDER OF THIS GUIDE IS FOR MERCHANTS THAT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH WEISHAAR.
----------------></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 29</a><div class="page-content">So you've talked with Weishaar and he's invited you to Al Ishaar for a "Tour." What does this mean?

The "Tour" is where you will select a vacant shop building for your tenancy. You are free to request transfer to another shop later if you wish!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 29</a><div class="page-content">I've selected my shop! Now what? 

In selecting your shop, Weishaar will likely reiterate the responsibilities you have to obey Augustan Law as well as to maintain your stock levels. He will likely have also discussed product / service</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 29</a><div class="page-content">options with you in order to ensure that you are prepared to enter with success!

If you accept the responsibilities of an Al Ishaar Merchant, Weishaar will now step back to let you get to work!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 29</a><div class="page-content">How do transactions work?

Buying and Selling things in Civcraft revolves around the "Shop Chest." These are regular or trapped chests that are modified by you to process transactions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 29</a><div class="page-content">So how do I make a shopchest?

1. Place a chest where you want it to remain;

2. In the top left slot, place the payment you wish to receive for your product;

3. In the slot immediately to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 29</a><div class="page-content">right, place the item your selling;

3. Close the chest;

4. while looking at the chest, open your dialogue and type /iec;

5. Green text should say something to the effect of "Creation Successful";</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 29</a><div class="page-content">6. Open the chest back up: you should see your payment in slot 1, product in slot 2, and two stone buttons. These make up the 'code' of the shopchest - removing them will deactivate the shop function of the chest;

7. At this point, you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 29</a><div class="page-content">can retrieve the payment item(s) and place additional product item(s) for multiple future transactions;

8. Finally, ensure that your shopchest is locked to others. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to lock chests AT MINIMUM to IRON level.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Congratulations! You have created your first shopchest! Be sure to post signage indicating what the deal is!

Check your chests regularly and stock reasonably. Stock too low and it's unreliable. Too high and you may bait thieves.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Watching your stock is important as it will not only keep your shop reliable, but it will help you find optimum pricing for your products. If you're having trouble keeping stocked, raise your prices. If cobblewebs are forming in your shop, lower them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 29</a><div class="page-content">Of course, you are the proprietor - only you know best for your business! Take the Al Ishaar rules to heart but the recommendations as just the suggestions they are.

And, as always, ask for help if needed!</div></div>
