The answer is that our great people bask in the glow of the virtues of a libertarian community, bonded through honour.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Other nations lean their obese governments against a railing of bureaucracy but, to this, I say: why build cold, concrete monolith of "Public Service" when the citizenry, armed with morality and duty, will be more than capable of providing support?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">With the constant flow of newfriends and the ever changing global political stage, it is imperative that our community of individuals be assured in their ability to exercise their free will in support of the Augustan People, unhindered by a slow governor</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">War or Political Strife is a characteristic of Civcraftian Life that is rarely avoided. Mount Augusta's system of governance is built is a way that minimizes another nation's ability to target Mount Augusta writ large for the actions of individuals.</div></div>

Those who deem themselves eligable to vote must endure the harm of submitting themselves to the word of the government insofar as to provide identification and proof of residency. This, of course, is</div></div>
