</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>1. God is what we know as the “the Father,” “Yahweh,” “the great I AM,” and “the Lord.”

2. The infinite and eternal God exists outside of physical law as He is both the creator and sustainer of the universe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">3. God created all the world out of His love.

4. Out of all of God's creatures, God set human beings apart.

5. He gifted them with consciousness and intelligence, making them in His image. Humans sounded the heartbeat of God.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 27</a><div class="page-content">6. God gave them this gift so that they could commune with Him, or live side by side in paradise.

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 27</a><div class="page-content">8. By rebelling against and rejecting God, humans were left to their own devices in the harsh new world.

9. Still, God wanted to have a relationship with His creation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 27</a><div class="page-content">10. God attempted to help human beings on Earth, sending out prophets of His word amongst the people.

13. Although, even as God's chosen people, the Jews sinned and continually fell out of God's grace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 27</a><div class="page-content">14. Yet, when the Jews earnestly asked for God's help and presence, He was there.

15. Eventually the Jewish people fell under the control of the Roman Empire.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 27</a><div class="page-content">16. For centuries the Jewish prophets had been predicting the Messiah.

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 27</a><div class="page-content">20. As such, God was born of a woman as Jesus Christ to fulfill what He had always intended.

25. In His death, Jesus took man's sin upon Himself, destroying it alongside death itself, in the process.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 27</a><div class="page-content">26. After His death, Jesus was resurrected and He showed Himself to His disciples.

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 27</a><div class="page-content">32. This is where YOU come in...

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>God has a plan for every person, including you. 

“I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb.”

<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 27</a><div class="page-content">is accept His love. Do this by repentence in His name and receive Christ into your heart.

Try this by praying:

“Lord Jesus, I believe you are the Son of God. I thank you for dying on the cross for my sins. Please forgive my sins and give me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 27</a><div class="page-content">the gift of eternal life. I ask you in to my life and heart to be my Lord and Savior. I want to serve you always. Amen."

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>There are plenty of reasons to have faith in Christianity, but not all reasons will convince all people. Certain apologetics that have been known to be of high quality include the book and documentary, The Case for Christ, which</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 27</a><div class="page-content">"deals in the argument from scripture. One book, Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, deals in the argument from morality. Another book, Reasonable Faith, deals in several different arguments. All are good resources, but you could also ask Christians you know"</div></div>
