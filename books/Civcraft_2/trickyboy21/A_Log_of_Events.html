Heading to sky city with Avery, to see how the rebuilding process is coming along. Mt. Agusta should be something cool to see. Won't be back in Haven for a long while, though. I've never gone farther than the Eastwood Logging Co.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14

It will be a really cool thing to see, but at the same time, I really, really don't like leaving Haven. It always gives me a homesick feeling that a game shouldn't be giving you. Glad that it does. Means i'm attached to Haven.</div></div>

Avery was someone I met in Carson. She is a very good ppls. Travelling with her is fun, and filled with conversation if not awkward due to all the minecart bumping incidents.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14. Complications

I've found a ghost town. Inactive. Las Malvinas. It looks like it had potential to be a cute litle community, but people leave, and the inactivity is what kills the town. This case is true for Malvinas, As it only had three</div></div>

buildings, and a farm. It's a shame to see villages, towns, cities, and civilizations fall. But it's even worse to find the ruins of one. Like an unmarked grave, you can only wonder what is was like.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14. Carson
---
After consulting a few people within the vicinity of Carson how to get to Carbon, we decided to take the Green Rail into Commonwealth, rather than pass Commonwealth on the Yellow Rail. Yellow or Green, if we get to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">"Carbon and it can\u0027t take us to Mt. Agusta, it won\u0027t matter which directon we take to get to Carbon."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14. Yellow Line

Commonwealth is amazing, and the Pink Line takes you just about anywhere. We went to Carbon, and are now riding the CIC to Mount Agusta. This has been a pretty long trip, and it was arduous, and painstaking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14. Mt. Agusta
---
We're in the station of Agusta, and will soon be taking the watervator to get topside. I don't know what we're gonna see, but Carson was really very cool looking, Commonwealth had an amazing mansion, and I hope that Agusta can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 31</a><div class="page-content">"top that, and if not, Sky City. It\u0027s been a long trip, and this has officially been the longest continuous play period of CivCraft I have ever done. Avery has brought a breath of fresh air to Civ, and I\u0027d like to thank her for that. Sorry, Ari."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">"I\u0027m more than a little excited, and I\u0027d like to know why they call it Mt. Agusta, what Biome it is, what architecture styles we should expect, what kind of forests they live near or within. So many questions. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 14. Upset

Agusta was... underwhelming, to say the least. Nice town though. We head to skycity on foot, as no rail lines run through it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 15. Sky City

We made it to Sky City. Avery logged, and left a sign message line explaining how she'll be staying there for a while. I'll have to make the journey back on my own.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 15. Cold
---
I've aimlessly travelled in the direction of Haven, thousands of blocks away, in the -,-. I'm in +,+. It'll be a long walk. I'm surrounded by snow and ice, and towering, thin pillars of dirt. These pillars have a dark purpose.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 15. Cold
---
It's very barren, and all I can find are unfinished, ravaged roads, and the skeletal corpses of small towns long abandoned by their citizens. The whole area feels void of life. I'm following roads that take me in the right direction,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 31</a><div class="page-content">but I just find them unfinished. It's a depressing choice of scenery, and the vague history it tells has no joy within it.

Nothing survived this cold.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 15. Carbon

After escaping the icy flatlands, I sailed across a vast body of water. Eventually finding what turned out to be the Carbon Jungle Colony. I took the rail back to Carbon, and am now riding down the Carbon-Commonwealth</div></div>

I was stopped on my way out of Commonwealth, by a strange fellow. He showed me these things he called 'pianos'. The word chicken was never mentioned. The noise it made was beautiful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 31</a><div class="page-content">April 15. Orion
---
We've stopped in Orion, as the creator of these pianos, GTAIVis thebest, ventured with me. We'll be taking the ShadyRail(TM) from Orion to Haven. We'll be picking up a few goods, then taking the ShadyRail.</div></div>

We've been in Haven a long time running. Well, I have. GTA left the day after he arrived in Haven. I'll be taking the CIC Green Line to Commonwealth, where this book will be copied and semi-mass produced.... for some reason. It's just a</div></div>

The adventure isn't over yet. This is a Log of Events, and I'm not yet done with my adventures. I'll be starting up a potion selling business. The problem is making potions that people will want to buy. I can make potions with</div></div>
