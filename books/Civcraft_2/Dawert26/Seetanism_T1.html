<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content"> In time of others, the others were seen by this one, and she saw the square upon which they lived and saw it alone but for the others, so she in turn of the kindness of others gave her gift on moon and sun, and the others lived in light not darkness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">On the next day, this one saw the others strike one another down. and saw these others called Hiper and Caly. watching in the safety of her realm, and saw the others of whom were friends of her friend be be claimed as ashes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">And so it was that this one found the darkness she had seen before her gifts, and thus then determined a judgement to the others, and on this day there would be no dead, and as the dead rise the sun will die, and the moon will be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">vanquished, and only when the quarrel ends will the judgement will be done. Then once this judgement stays done, then the choice is made,  and when they fight untill night is over, death will follow when UNIVERSE SEED sees our world unfit for others,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">and her faith is gone, and the lights will be out, and seetanists will pray, and the servants will be taken to paradise.

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">so saw this one saw her friends upon thy leaves.

This one found her kin tossed as ash was tossed. Then it was there that this one passed judgement.

This one saw murder when Caly and Hiper entered. Then it was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">there that judgement was passed.


This one saw the others suffer. Pain ensued. There was energy no more left. so upon this square This one placed more seeds, but each seed saw it's chance and bore it's own fruits,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 25</a><div class="page-content">which provided the energy which was no more, and then there was the others who changed of the seeds, so there were cows, sheep, horses, and men.
