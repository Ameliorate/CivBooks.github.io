I have decided to go on a journey to see the world. I'm leaving Blue for the time being, but expect to return.

I am leaving from the town of Versailles, and plan on heading to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">the commonwealth and finding my path from there.

2/20/2015 3:30
Decided to timestamp my entries, since I will be making multiple a day. I just fucked up trying to get to commonwealth, and my minecart is on it's way there without me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">2/20/2015 3:18
I have finally arrived in the commonwealth. I am greeted by a large obsidian wall, and it seems I must ask for access

3:23
Changed the entry format yet again. Now I'm only dating when the date changes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Anyway, I've gained entry to shopside to look around for a bit. I guess I'm traveling north from here. 

3:28
I've gotten up to what I assume is the residential area, The tall buildings are pretty swish, not what I expected</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">3:48 Departing Commonwealth. Saw some pretty cool things here, but not much. At least there's a rail hub. I was told by someone that Mt. Augusta was worth looking at, so I'm heading there. Going to stop at Carbon on the way. Here are some screenshots from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">my look around Commonwealth

4:00
I've arrived in Carbon. This place is really fucking square and a grid. Can't wait to leave this shithole island,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">but worth it to at least take a look around first.

4:05
Leaving Carbon. Fuck this place. Next destination is Mt. Augusta. Sounds pretty cool, Hopefully I won't be dissapointed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">4:14
Mt. Augusta isn't an actual mountain. I'm dissapointed. Fuck this shit, time to head home

4:24 Instead of changing at Carbon to go home, I decided to visit SPQR. I hear it is the most northward active city. I'm going to Carson from Carbon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">5:27
Blue convinced me to go to SPQR. He said it was active, but I don't see any people here. Fuck.

6:43
Back home. Fuck this place, at least it's less shitty then the other towns out there.</div></div>
