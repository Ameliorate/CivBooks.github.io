<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">If I try hard enough, I can still remember- vividly at times- that first, mysterious house. Sometimes I wonder if it even existed at all, even though the memories that resurface are far too vivid to have been from a dream, or from my imagination.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">I remember it as if it was yesterday, a large, empty concrete house, cooled by the third-world air conditioning. The windows let in the blinding light from the outside. The peculiar smell, earthy and musty, only occasionally returning to me in flashes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The cupboards were usually empty save for the essentials; a box of vanilla-flavoured cereal, boxed tea, sweet bread sitting on the counter sprinkled with small pieces of caramelized sugar.

Upstairs was large and cooled and smelled of carpets.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The spacious open hallways led to my bedroom. It was a comfortable room, the air conditioning was powerful and let in the filtered air of summer 2008 from the outside. In the echoey corridor close by was half-opened door to the bathroom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">At night, you could slide the screen door open and step onto the second floor balcony. The lights of the commercial center on the side of the highway glimmered brightly on the horizon. Darkened swaying palm trees, a grassy, calming smell, sometimes the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">night brought warm, still air and silence, other times it brought wet rain and thunder, lightning flashing on the horizon, illuminating the covered city for an instant.

Things lived in that house, we would find dead carcasses on the bathroom floor,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">unnaturally huge. The rustling black masses crossed over when the leaves of the palm trees touched the stucco of the house. Traces of them sometimes in the kitchen, freshly dead or dying, still oily, convulsing on the countertops or on the floors. If you</div></div>

We moved from that house only two months after we had arrived.</div></div>

The last few days were spent moving unpacked boxes back to the first floor. The floor there was marble, cool to the touch. We drank often to quench our</div></div>

The grassy cactus smell coming over from the burning fields was prevalant outside in the daytime, but there</div></div>

We moved all the boxes to the van from the house on the last day and it stood, gutted and empty once more. The upstairs room wa no longer comfortable or quiet, it was bare and stifling, like a wretched government prison cell in the</div></div>

The rustlers had taken over. From the basement they crawled in droves, there were almosts as many corpses, bloated and rotting, as there were living ones. The battery box was not</div></div>
