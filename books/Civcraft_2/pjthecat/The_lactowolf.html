<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">It all began one fateful morning when the local farmer, Mushroomfly, noticed that his cows had already been milked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The creatures looked very distressed and the air was filled with a peculiar scent. Similar to that of the huntsmans home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Mushroomfly had stumbled upon a terrible secret. A creature thought to be myth had made its home in Tazmily</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A creature with only one weakness. A weakness that it had brought light to by its attempts to remove all traces from the town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">You see, this was a warewolf, and not just any warewolf. It was a lactowolf. This warewolf was lactose intolerant. The standard weakness to bullets had somehow mutated  into an intolerance to lactose.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">With mushroomfly's cows milked, the town of Tazmily was now defenceless against the power of the lactowolf. This lactowolf didn't want to chance consuming anyone that had milk or cheese in their belly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Mushroomfly heard something stir behind him. He turned to see a very hairy man clothed in rags that barely covered him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The man lunged at mushroomfly and tore and him with teeth and nail until the farmer was nothing more than a lifeless mess amongst the hay.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The man retreated to the swamp where he would wait until nightfall. For tonight would be the full moon, and he was ready to sate the blood lust that had been building inside him for a month.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The moon was high and bright in the sky when the first screams pierced  the night in the kitty cat district. Residents of the quant cul-de-sac were being torn limb from limb by the wolf.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The screams were quickly silenced as each person fell to the lactowolfs blows. With blood dripping from his maw he made his way up the high street towards to town center.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The screams had not reached this far, and the sleeping townsfolk had not been alerted to the presence of danger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A tall house was the lactowolfs first target. He spied a light on in the kitchen and readied himself to burst through the window.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">There was a small girl pouring herself a drink on the counter top. As the lactowolf burst in through the window she screamed in terror and flung her arms up in to the air.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The wolf realised too late that it was a glass of milk she was pouring. In her fear the girl had knocked the glass into the air, spilling milk all over the wolf.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Tears welled up in his eyes as he began to scream and shriek in pain. Writhing and crying on the floor of the kitchen the wolf was unable to resist the effect that the milk had on him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The girl had no idea the power of the beast she had just slain, but she was lucky to be alive.
