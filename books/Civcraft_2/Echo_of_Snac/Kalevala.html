BIRTH OF WAINAMOINEN

In primeval times, a
 maiden,
Beauteous Daughter
 of the Ether,
Passed for ages her
 existence
In the great expanse
 of heaven,
O'er the prairies yet
 enfolded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Wearisome the maiden
 growing,
Her existence sad
 and hopeless,
Thus alone to live
 for ages
In the infinite
 expanses
Of the air above the
 sea-foam,
In the far
 outstretching
 spaces,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 49</a><div class="page-content">In a solitude of
 ether,
She descended to the
 ocean,
Waves her coach, and
 waves her pillow.
Thereupon the rising
 storm-wind
Flying from the East in
 fierceness,
Whips the ocean into
 surges,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Strikes the stars with
 sprays of ocean
Till the waves are
 white with fervor.
To and fro they toss
 the maiden,
Storm-encircled,
 hapless maiden;
With her sport the
 rolling billows,
With her play the
 storm-wind forces,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 49</a><div class="page-content">On the blue back of
 the waters;
On the white-wreathed
 waves of ocean,
Play the forces of the
 salt-sea,
With the lone and
 helpless maiden;
Till at last in full
 conception,
Union now of force
 and beauty,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Sink the storm-winds
 into slumber;
Overburdened now the
 maiden
Cannot rise above the
 surface;
Seven hundred years
 she wandered,
Ages nine of man's
 existence,
Swam the ocean hither,
 thither,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Could not rise above
 the waters,
Conscious only of her
 travail;
Seven hundred years
 she labored
Ere her first-born
 was delivered.
Thus she swam as
 water-mother,
Toward the east, and
 also southward,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Toward the west, and
 also northward;
Swam the sea in all
 directions,
Frightened at the
 strife of
 storm-winds,
Swam in travail, swam
 unceasing,
Ere her first-born
 was delivered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Then began she gently
 weeping,
Spake these measures,
 heavy-hearted:
"Woe is me, my life
 hard-fated!
Woe is me, in this my
 travail!
Into what have I now
 fallen?
Woe is me, that I
 unhappy,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Left my home in subtle
 ether,
Came to dwell amid the
 sea-foam,
To be tossed by
 rolling billows,
To be rocked by winds
 and waters,
On the far
 outstretching
 waters,
In the salt-sea's
 vast expanses,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Knowing only pain and
 trouble!
Better far for me, O
 Ukko!
Were I maiden in the
 Ether,
Than within these
 ocean-spaces,
To become a
 water-mother!
All this life is cold and
 dreary,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Painful here is every
 motion,
As I linger in the
 waters,
As I wander through
 the ocean.
Ukko, thou O God, up
 yonder,
Thou the ruler of the
 heavens,
Come thou hither, thou
 art needed,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Come thou hither, I
 implore thee,
To deliver me from
 trouble,
To deliver me in
 travail.
Come I pray thee,
 hither hasten,
Hasten more that thou
 art needed,
Haste and help this
 helpless maiden!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 49</a><div class="page-content">When she ceased her
 supplications,
Scarce a moment
 onward passes,
Ere a beauteous
 duck descending,
Hastens toward the
 water-mother,
Comes a-flying hither,
 thither,
Seeks herself a place
 for nesting.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Flies she eastward,
 flies she westward,
Circles northward,
 circles southward,
Cannot find a grassy
 hillock,
Not the smallest bit
 of verdure;
Cannot find a spot
 protected,
Cannot find a place
 befitting,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Where to make her
 nest in safety.
Flying slowly, looking
 round her,
She descries no
 place for resting,
Thinking loud and
 long debating,
And her words are
 such as follow:
"Build I in the winds my
 dwelling,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 49</a><div class="page-content">On the floods my
 place of nesting?
Surely would the
 winds destroy it,
Far away the waves
 would wash it."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Then the daughter of
 the Ether,
Now the hapless
 water-mother,
Raised her shoulders
 out of water,
Raised her knees
 above the ocean,
That the duck might
 build her dwelling,
Build her
 nesting-place in
 safety.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Thereupon the duck
 in beauty,
Flying slowly, looking
 round her,
Spies the shoulders of
 the maiden,
Sees the knees of
 Ether's daughter,
Now the hapless
 water-mother,
Thinks them to be
 grassy hillocks,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">On the blue back of
 the ocean.
Thence she flies and
 hovers slowly,
Lightly on the knee
 she settles,
Finds a nesting-place
 befitting,
Where to lay her
 eggs in safety.
Here she builds her
 humble dwelling,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Lays her eggs within,
 at pleasure,
Six, the golden eggs
 she lays there,
Then a seventh, an
 egg of iron;
Sits upon her eggs to
 hatch them,
Quickly warms them on
 the knee-cap
Of the hapless
 water-mother;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Hatches one day,
 then a second,
Then a third day sits
 and hatches.
Warmer grows the water
 round her,
Warmer is her bed in
 ocean,
While her knee with
 fire is kindled,
And her shoulders
 too are burning,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Fire in every vein is
 coursing.
Quick the maiden
 moves her
 shoulders,
Shakes her members
 in succession,
Shakes the nest from
 its foundation,
And the eggs fall into
 ocean,
Dash in pieces on the
 bottom</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Of the deep and
 boundless waters.
In the sand they do
 not perish,
Not the pieces in the
 ocean;
But transformed, in
 wondrous beauty
All the fragments
 come together
Forming pieces two in
 number,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">One the upper, one
 the lower,
Equal to the one, the other.
From one half the egg, the lower,
Grows the nether
 vault of Terra:
From the upper half
 remaining,
Grows the upper
 vault of Heaven;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">From the white part
 come the moonbeams,
From the yellow part
 the sunshine,
From the motley part
 the starlight,
From the dark part
 grows the cloudage;
And the days speed
 onward swiftly,
Quickly do the years
 fly over,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">From the shining of
 the new sun
From the lighting of
 the full moon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Still the daughter of
 the Ether,
Swims the sea as
 water-mother,
With the floods
 outstretched before
 her,
And behind her sky
 and ocean.
Finally about the
 ninth year,
In the summer of the
 tenth year,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Lifts her head above
 the surface,
Lifts her forehead
 from the waters,
And begins at last
 her workings,
Now commences her
 creations,
On the azure
 water-ridges,
On the mighty waste
 before her.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Where her hand she
 turned in water,
There arose a fertile
 hillock;
Wheresoe'er her foot
 she rested,
There she made a
 hole for fishes;
Where she dived
 beneath the waters,
Fell the many deeps of
 ocean;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Where upon her side
 she turned her,
There the level
 banks have risen;
Where her head was
 pointed landward,
There appeared wide
 bays and inlets;
When from shore she
 swam a distance,
And upon her back
 she rested,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 49</a><div class="page-content">There the rocks she
 made and fashioned,
And the hidden reefs
 created,
Where the ships are
 wrecked so often,
Where so many lives
 have perished.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Thus created were
 the islands,
Rocks were fastened
 in the ocean,
Pillars of the
 sky were planted,
Fields and forests
 were created,
Checkered stones of
 many colors,
Gleaming in the silver
 sunlight,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">All the rocks stood
 well established;
But the singer,
 Wainamoinen,
Had not yet beheld the
 sunshine,
Had not seen the
 golden moonlight,
Still remaining
 undelivered.
Wainamoinen, old and
 trusty,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Lingering within his
 dungeon
Thirty summers
 altogether,
And of winters,
 also thirty,
Peaceful on the
 waste of waters,
On the broad-sea's
 yielding bosom,
Well reflected, long
 considered,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 49</a><div class="page-content">How unborn to live
 and flourish
In the spaces
 wrapped in
 darkness,
In uncomfortable
 limits,
Where he had not seen
 the moonlight,
Had not seen the
 silver sunshine.
Thereupon these
 words be uttered,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Let himself be heard
 in this wise:
"Take, O Moon, I pray
 thee, take me,
Take me, thou, O Sun
 above me,
Take me, thou O Bear
 of heaven,
From this dark and
 dreary prison,
From these unbefitting
 portals,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 49</a><div class="page-content">From this narrow
 place of resting,
From this dark and
 gloomy dwelling,
Hence to wander
 from the ocean,
Hence to walk upon
 the islands,
On the dry land walk
 and wander,
Like an ancient hero
 wander,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Walk in open air and
 breathe it,
Thus to see the
 moon at evening,
Thus to see the silver
 sunlight,
Thus to see the Bear
 in heaven,
That the stars I may
 consider."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Since the Moon
 refused to free him,
And the Sun would not
 deliver,
Nor the Great Bear
 give assistance,
His existence growing
 weary,
And his life but an
 annoyance,
Bursts he then the
 outer portals</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Of his dark and
 dismal fortress;
With his strong, but
 unnamed finger,
Opens he the lock
 resisting;
With the toes upon his
 left foot,
With the fingers of his
 right hand,
Creeps he through the
 yielding portals</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 49</a><div class="page-content">To the threshold of
 his dwelling;
On his knees across
 the threshold,
Throws himself head
 foremost, forward
Plunges into deeps of
 ocean,
Plunges hither,
 plunges thither,
Turning with his hands
 the water;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Swims he northward,
 swims he southward,
Swims he eastward,
 swims he westward,
Studying his new
 surroundings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Thus our hero
 reached the water,
Rested five years in
 the ocean,
Six long years, and
 even seven years,
Till the autumn of the
 eighth year,
When at last he leaves
 the waters,
Stops upon a
 promontory,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 49</a><div class="page-content">On a coast bereft of
 verdure;
On his knees he leaves
 the ocean,
On the land he plants
 his right foot,
On the solid ground
 his left foot,
Quickly turns his
 hands about him,
Stands erect to see
 the sunshine,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Stands to see the
