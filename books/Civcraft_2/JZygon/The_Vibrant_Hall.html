The walls, still littered with various paintings and other decor, seemed to almost shriek out in an attempt to grab his attention.

He started analyzing it stroke by stroke, line by line until he soaked the whole image in.

There was a caption below the painting that read "To Have Everything and Nothing" as the title of the piece.  He started to move away from the painting and felt a suddent urge to turn around to inspect it once again. To his shock, the masked man</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 35</a><div class="page-content">"had vanished from the painting and left behind his golden throne. He attempted to convince himself that the man had simply never existed and moved onto the next painting he could find."</div></div>

There were many trees in the surrounding area and the focus of the painting was in one of the shaded areas. The caption below the painting, denoting the title, read "A Spring to Remember." There was a picnic blanket set</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Upon his visit the next day, the once empty hall had been filled up to a fairly generous amount. It was the most people he had ever seen in the hall in</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was months before he came back to that hall again to try to solve his problem.  The hall had become very famous over the time he had been gone and it was packed quite tightly. He decided to</div></div>

All of a sudden he felt a slight touch upon his shoulder and he flung himself around to confront the probing hand. Behind him stood a man, not much taller than him, with brown hair and green eyes.
