<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"I\u0027ve seen a lot of changes over the years, such as a change in social attitudes - ancaps believed strongly in complete freedom of speech. Slurs that are now a bannable offence were commonplace, as were casual sexism, racism and other bigotry."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"There has been a marked decline in political discussion - the subreddit used to be a battleground between capitalism, socialism, anarchism and fascism.

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"2.0 has also seen the exodus of the ancaps, once the major power on Civcraft and the now inactivity of the LSIF, the other great anarchist presence on the server."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"I would say that currently we have more wealth but less discussion.

<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"The server was safe enough that the majority of people walked around naked for most of the time, focusing more on building and debate than fighting over land."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"There is greater playerbase diversity at the cost of intimacy on the subreddit - most people had at least passing acquaintance on 1.0 and you would usually know a fair bit about their city as well."</div></div>
