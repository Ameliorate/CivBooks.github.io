We have engineered a Spider Spawner to eliminate the Cave Spiders so that we may collect their item drops. However we mostly seem to be getting string and not that much of it. So as the CEOs of A&V Corporations we have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"decided to initiat Phase One of the Spider Elimination Project."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 2

Acuring enchanted Swords with a high looting aspect we have managed to aquire much more string and spider eyes then we ever could have with the Drop of Death. The way we have done this is by destroying a small section of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"wall just above where the flow of water begins. The spiders find it quite difficult to make it up the water and this gives our employees the chance to eliminate them without getting harmed."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 3

There has been an incident. An employee was attacked, bitten and poisoned. Luckily no harm came to him as the poison wore off rather soon. Though this does bid the question how did the spider work its way to the top of the water</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"within biting range. Further research is required."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 4

It's odd. Since the wall was opened the spiders have far more agressive and far more intelligent. They have managed to work their way to the top of the water and jump out. We sustained several casualities. We have decided that we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"must initiate the Security Phase if we are to proceed to Phase 2 of the Project."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 5

The Security Phase is complete. We have developed a pathway leading away from the Spider labs to a more secure area. It is a corridor with a hint of a maze. The test showed that the Spiders found it too difficult to navigate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"through the corridor and were halted at the first Checkpoint. This rendered the Security Phase a success and we may now continue to Phase 2 as planned."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 6

Without casualities for several days we have now decided to begin planning on a way to initiate Phase 2, the most complex Phase. We want to somehow drive the Spiders to the surface and either defend Balkania or defend A&V</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"Corporations. To get them to the surface we think a simple water lift will suffice. However we will need to study the Spiders and find out how they will react when they are released outside."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 7

Another small outbreak occured. No casualities this time but a few injuries. One Spider made it through the first Checkpoint and got halted at the second. Scientist assure me that it was merely a fluke and that the chances of it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"happening again are highly unlikely. We have begun ideas for a new Security Phase. We can not initiate it yet, but if this happens again we may not have a choice."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Entry 8

Major Outbreak. Spiders have made their way out of the Spawning Labs and past security Checkpoints 1, 2 and 3. We have sustained a high number of casualities. Although the Drop of Death method did not yeild</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">nearly the same amount of items as the Spider Elimination Project did, we do not have another choice.

-Spider Elimination Project Terminated</div></div>
