<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>                            The following is the account of one Quauhtli as Yoahtl's third chieftain upon Melonia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Like a great purge, EndlessCraft was no more. The saga of Inmysovietrussia done as the last Wayon-Dot fades into history.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But onto this the worries and troubles of Yoahtl grew as those of whome who were Yoahtl, all too suddenly were lost</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, the atrocities and horrors of the Great War was still fresh in my mind, and I was in a very troubled state of mind.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Though I did look for a new server to call home, for a moment I felt as though Yoahtl was done.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Eventually I found Melonia, MelonCraft. A cracked fledgling server, that showed great promise with it's wide array of servers, spanning from Creative, -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">minigames, and ofcourse, Survival.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>In my most troubled and discumbobulated state of mind, I sought only to rest and find peace in it's Creative server, where I spent a week building in peace, in a short lived and dillusional safe space.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I would build Wooden mansions, gardens, and even a spleef arena within 4 days, and within 2 of those days I would rank up to an "advanced" builder rank, as Melonia held to the belief in ranks, as they would to staff and donators.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But after those 4 days,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I felt at fault.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For every build I had created, I felt as though I had betrayed what made me what I am, one extra time.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I spent time in contemplation and meditation, for a very short time before realizing, how blinded</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I was by my own emotions. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I left creative, with rank in mind. To survival, determined to recreate Yoahtl once more in this new and brave server..<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was excited and relived that I have left my sobbing old life behind. As short as it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">was.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But the moment I typed /server Main. I was in a brave, new, magical, wonderous world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Spawn was bigger than any Civian City, made from Wool, Black being the main color, but with different colored lining for every different-</div></div>

But in the middle of it all. A statue, as tall as the Spawn, and as detailed as the smallest crevices. Dedicated to the Melonian's diety, Melonius. Holding A longsword into what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">appeared to be a giant Melon. By this time it was obvious that the Melon block was the symbol of this great server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But as I looked around it's very large and rather crowded corridors,  I saw people... flying.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">For certain I thought they were moderators or admins. But then i noticed someone to whom I thought was a player like myself levitate from the floor and zip through the Sky!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Was it possible that to fly was a feature of this Server?!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It was, as I flipped through /Help commands, I saw it; /fly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And upon typing it in, a message appeared in my chat bar: " You feel your feet pull from the ground "<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was ecstatic.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Already then I felt like an angel or an eagle flying and zipping through the massive corridors of Melonia's Spawn.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But as fun and exciting as it was, it took me 10 minutes to find the way out into the wilderness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">When I saw the entrance I already knew where I was headed. Toward the rising and dawning sun.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Knowing that speed from flight was staple for most people at this point, i knew my voyage would not be shortned, for I sought to find a place far from any</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">new or old settlement, as Yoahtl always would.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The wilderness seemed normal at first, simple forests and beaches scattered. But then I noticed it began to change as I went on.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Mountains and trees, bigger. And the all the more strange.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Eventually trees would be seen the size of a skyscraper. as Mountains would be seen be big enough to reach the skylimit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Trees got stranger as well. for as they looked bigger, I'd see trees grow not in thier native biome. It was beautiful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It truly felt I was in a new land and server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I felt as though I had just arrived from a ship to the New World.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>New sights, creatures, people and ways of living.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Jungles that only poka dots of light on it's floors. And deserts at sizes too large to tell.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And after nearly 3 hours of flying towards the sun. I had finally found it, the place where I would settle and rebuild Yoahtl once more.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>There stood a Mountain so tall, so vast. The top was made perfectly flat for miles across. For it had reached the-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Sky limit. With entire lakes and oceans under under and even IN the massive mountain, with one valley sized crater to the east, with a enourmous lake at it's footing, so deep it reached bedrock.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Whilst instantly finding this behemoth of a mountain.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I noticed a relatively large cave within the base of the formation. Twas a small lake within the mountain, surrounded by stone with tall but small entrance/exit.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The trees surrounding the area were Spruce and nearly 10x larger than a normal size.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The biome surrounding the mountain tundra forest, but the mountain itself seemed to be much much warmer. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I had decided to setup a settlement within the cave lake, and give the mountain A name ; Popec, and the new settlement;<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Popectlan.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The water of the lake would seep outwards outside from the talle entrance, creating something of a large pond. Which I would use to create a Farm.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I would then painstakingly cut the enourmous trees.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Then use the wood to create tools and wooden pathways into and out of the cave, aesthetically creating supports to the wooden pier-like walkways on the sides of the cave. Digging into the walls to create rooms.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">But like E.C and a grand majority of the servers Yoahtl has visited, much of it's ways are supported on the need for the Factions plugin.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So naturally I created a faction " Yoahtl ".<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then began the task of gaining members.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Because none of the old Yoahtlan from E.C's Wayon-Dot were ever able to know where I was, I had to start completly fresh. Not knowing what i'd get into recruiting new People. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So after slowly gaining new members ( to whom were barely active at all)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I set a policy for MINIMAL interaction with other peoples in fear of bieng attacked by other factions or raiders.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And very slowly, but surely, Yoahtl began to grow. 6 members holding fast to remain at that member count.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">We were in the Shadow of other factions, much larger at the time. Factions like the Aishunnns, to whom would bolst a boastful 56-70 members strong. Yoahtl wasnt at all, relevant. And I knew this.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I went out looking for other nearby factions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Hoping to recreate the old Wayon-Dot. Though ofcourse I'd stay within the same continent.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I did find some, but there were either as tiny or tinnier than Yoahtl, and barely active at all.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A small recreation of Wayon-Dot was propped up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">But it was short lived and irrelevant to any factional power in the server.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But then I noticed my Rank, to which had givin me a Yellow name, unique to the normal Green names any regular player would have.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I quickly used this as an advantage to gain new members, with success!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I would have met Yoahtl's first loyalist member, Deluxee, and his friend Walrus.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At this point Yoahtl finally saw promise of a future in Melonia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">But it was also my meeting with Deluxee and Walrus, I found that Melonia was a server in which war was barely posible, in which it was only permitted in the "wilderness" areas. Areas not claimed by factions.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was overjoyed as well as-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">some what follied to hear this, for I hid in a cave because out of fear of an attack.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So I went out to look for relations with Melonia's natives. And I eventually came across a Large nation of Hunger-Games based players. To whom prided themselves with.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The HGK they called themselves " Hunger-Games Kings"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I would meet them in thier Desert city, of the same name. And over a span of a month I saw them grow to be bigger than even the Admin-led Aishunnns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">After of which, I would come to witness Melonia's first Real attempt at empire, and Imperialism.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>HGK.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Thier leader Shamnus, and I became good friends, as we often shared the same aspirations for our peoples.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">After of which, We began to trade with each other, Our farmed goods, for some of thier mined materials, mostly stone.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As HGK began to create small colonies in different parts of Melonia, Yoahtl was beggining to grow. As our village soon became a town.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The huehuetlic style would be evident in our architecture, mostly due to the fact I was usually the one building. But many of our projects took place WITHIN Mount Popec. As more pier-like walk ways went in, out, and across the walls of the cave systems.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">And even eventually began to go across the very cliffs and slopes of mount Popec itself, Windows of large rooms could be seen from it's side. Houses both inside and out.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Life in Yoahtl at the time, was simple, and fun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I would often contemplate, while i build.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The vibes were good, the times were good and life overall seemed to be good.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">After trading, relations and overall closeness between the HGK and Yoahtl grew, so did Yoahtl.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Though we were just a town of about 20, we all felt as though we were growing, there was a perpetual state of excited Calmness.</div></div>
