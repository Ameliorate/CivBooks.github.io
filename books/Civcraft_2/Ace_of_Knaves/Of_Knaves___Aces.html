Once upon a time (25th of June to be precise) I found myself aimlessly pressing that "random" button on reddit in search of some aid to the lethargy that struck me on that very day. Curiously I stumbled upon an obscure</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">subreddit of a politically themed minecraft server which aquired my attention with it's seriously toned threads of political nature about a popular game that I used to play. It had it's own wiki and a website on the interwebs which led</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">me to believe that it indeed is a well organized thing in nature, rather than some other things in nature that are not well organized. So I went to the wiki to inform myself about the mods being used there, and I remember reading about PrisonPearl</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and the ore veins thinking to myself: "Holy shit, this is hard core"!
So I started reading. I must have devoured at least a day on the wiki in preparation for what is to become my entering the world of CivCraft. Nervously I pressed the login button</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and woke up in unfamiliar place. Hungry and with no tools or shelter, fearing for my very own life I climbed onto the nearby hill to scout the area around me. I was on an island with high cliffs and very few trees. Exposed stone,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">barren of coal or any kind of ore greeted me with it's dull grey look. Surely a non-welcoming sight to a newcomer.
With no food or shelter I survived by breaking oak leaves that others left floating around and hiding in the tree until the night</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">passed. With barely enough food left on my HUD I caught a glimpse of some figure entering the cave in the steep side of a mountain. He disappeared from the radar so I decided to follow him. Upon entering what looked like a shelter of some poor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">traveler, I noticed a bed, a single chest and a portal and no trace of a man who, moments ago, disappeared into the gloomy purpleness of the dark void inside. Quickly I robbed the chest of precious food all the time looking at the grim whirlpool of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Nether-kind, fearing that the owner of the place will return and pearl me on sight for an act of thievery I had committed. After checking the player list I decided that he must have logged in the Nether so I entered the portal, having nowhere else to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">go. The island was unhospitable and I needed food badly.
I noticed a very long and narrow passageway trough the hellish biomes of Nether. I must have followed the path for about a seven hundred meters when I came to what looked like a secret farm</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of some sort. Rows upon rows of nether warts laid planted with Jack'o'lanterns providing only a faint light in this grave place that filled me with dread with every second that passed. A sign stood there saying "Brothers of Sweaty Balls", stating the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">ownership of the place to some rather young and immature group of people. "This will give me a nice head start", I thought to myself, "when I go trading for food'n'stuff in the first civilized town that I find"."Brothers of Sweaty Balls" surely</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">didn't seem like a well cultured bunch of people so I politely collected as much of precious weed and sand I could fit in my inventory and went on my merry way into the portal below.
It was dark when the purple cloud of miasma disappeared and as I opened</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">my eyes it took me a brief moment to adjust my sight to a blackness of the place. I found myself in an underground mine shaft long abandoned by it's original owners. The place was barely lit by torches which burned with their yellowish flame and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">cold, barren stone that made the walls of the passages gave the place a steely blue look. It was a maze of twisty little passages all alike. The same group of people that owned the farm made a base there so I decided to head out as fast as possible.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">This place must have been at least 30 meters underground but there was no sign of a ladder or any kind of way leading out. I was trapped, in this gravely tomb, with no tools on me I had no choice but to follow this maze in search of daylight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">As I passed the mossy room I heard what sounded like a pile of sticks clacking together, the sound of the clacking was sharp and it traveled far trough the long and abandoned tunnels in which creatures of night spawned and I knew, something evil is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">on my trail. Startled, I stood in terror as, much to my own amazement a cuboid cage in front of me, burning with eldrich fire produced a terrible sight. A skeletal creature armed with crude bow appeared in front of me. The creature, summoned by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">eldrich magic of the neferous cube clacked towards me loading the deadly arrow which it spun out of thin air. It's empty eyes showeing no sight of any conscious thought looked trough me. It shoot at me and I, fleeing, fell from the broken bridge</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">when I was suddenly hit in the shoulder, and a cave, deeper then eye can see swallowed me.
I was alone, on the bottom of the cave, fighting for my own life. It was dark and I was hungry. If only I could eat nether warts.
I started digging</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">with my bare hands a way out of this underground tomb. I sensed a warm stench behind me, a loud shriek, when a huge, poisonous spider greeted me with it's glowing fangs and I logged out, fearing that I might lose everything.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">
In real life it was already late, the night had come without me even noticing, and a burning hole in the stomach reminded me of the addicting nature of the world I had entered.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">       Chapter 2

The next day, after gathering courage I decided to fight the monster and logged on only to find no trace of him and as the wave of cold relief passed me as I continued to make my way out of the hole. On the surface, a soft snow had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">fallen overnight and unsuspecting sheep grazed there as I murdered them and out of their blood stained wool I fashioned a bed with which I set my spawn in a dirt hut below.
It was then that I noticed an old and damaged wall of what looked like a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">half finished fort. A reminiscent of wars passed, the fort lay abandoned or half constructed while the burning forest nearby reminded me of the savage nature of life in this lands. I made my way to north and while passing several griefed forts made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in the desert I decided to make my home in a ruined town named "Central". There were still no traces of other players so I naturally concluded that "Central" must have been build on top of an ore vein and when the vein was depleted a gold rush made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the whole town move to the next place with underground riches to excavate. I believed at the time that the ONLY place ore can be found on this world was inside the veins and that the trees would not grow naturally at all thus forcing players to live</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in a tight communities in order to survive, let alone prosper.
Systematically I searched half-robbed houses that stood there finding only traces of what must have been a wealthy town in it's day. One house stood there, ungriefed,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">unbroken, with an iron golem guarding it's interior. "What a waste of resources" I thought. "This player must be wealthy to spend his iron on a expensive automaton like that".
I broke trough the reinforcements in the window and killed the creature with a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">stone sword, collecting a handful of metal it left behind. The house was protected with iron but one part of it, right behind the stairs was brilliantly reinforced with diamond. I knew there must be something below but I didn't have any tools so I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">left the house and made a dirt hut on a hill beside, Waiting, for an unsuspecting owner to return.
A player entered my chat range and presented himself promptly. I hid inside my stone-reinforced hut and watched as he looted the sandstone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">structure of little wealth it still contained. He had iron armor and diamond tools and I told him about the diamond reinforced block that I found. He offered me to work with him, He would provide me with tools and upon breaking the vault, we would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">provide me with tools and upon breaking the vault, we would share whatever wealth was held inside. I didn't know if I could trust him, but greed in me was strong and I accepted.
I spent the next couple of hours breaking into the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">chest, I taped my left button and waited while the vault became weaker with every hit that I made. Suddenly, a gush of riches came out of the chest and I found myself unable to hold all the items that spilled onto the floor and around. Erraticly, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">started collecting the loot, stuffing my inventory with precious metals and rare, forever burning rods, robbed of a slain nether demon whose body was made of living fire.
There must have been at least 5 diamonds there and a half</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">stack of iron, I also found a potion with magical properties and a diamond pick gleaming with a strange blue shine, "Unbreaking II" was engraved on the tool and I was happy for a moment but my luck was cut short with a sharp snap of an iron sword hit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">me with such surprise that I jumped out of my chair. Adrenaline rushed in as I was betrayed by the same man that I, moments ago considered an ally . I woke up in my bed and quickly made my way back to fight for my share of the loot but when I got</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">there, he was already gone.
"No honor among thieves" I said to myself as I sadly collected what little stuff the attacker had left behind. Angry I decided to wreck havoc upon the place, "I will turn this town upside-down, but I'm not leaving</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">without being paid", for a honest work of thievery that I did that day.
The rightful owner of the place appeared, angry upon seeing his vault broken he accused me of the theft which I admitted after which we exchanged
a couple of hits</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">when he defeated me in battle and I once again woke up in my dirty hut in a snowy forest nearby.
The place was rightfully dangerous so I headed out to the sea and some two hundred and fifty meters away I dug out an underground hole in which I hid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">my items. It was then when I saw a player on the radar passing above me. Stevo_1066 said on his name plate, he went to the shore and then, noticing me swum back to my hidden hole and standing on the doorway greeted me, in full diamond armor and with a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">diamond sword, while I, mortified, reinforced my door with an iron ingot, walling myself in I told him to leave me alone, which he, visibly insulted did.
The next day when I logged on, my house had already been broken into, the chests were still</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">there but the attackers had locked them with iron and I spend the very good part of the day reclaiming my rightfully stolen property. They also left a fashionable portal in my living room out of which they apparently escaped. I had a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">bounty on my head so I searched the subreddit for a town that would let the apparent criminal live in. I heard for one place but It was kilometers away and I was scared that somebody would break into my house and steal what's left inside. The fear of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">being robbed on my way was greater and I left on foot toward a town of Columbia, the most inhibited place on the server so far. I had no idea where Columbia was but I was determined to find it. On my way I got lost in a huge forest and it was there</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that I stumbled upon a tower of some kind, the signs there said "LSF outpost" and voices in my chat range suggested that they were a rather violent group of people. People who would kill me on sight if I trespassed their property. A various books of</div></div>

A sign on the wall claimed place to be named "Mt.Augusta". The town looked rather small and I said to myself: "There is no way this place catches on" so I went on, eventually coming back to my hole in the ground.</div></div>
