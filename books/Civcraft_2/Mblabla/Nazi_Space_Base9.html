<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content"> Hans remarked at how dark and peaceful it was on Greenhouse Pod One "Then again" he muttered to himself, "It's always dark and peaceful on the dark side of the moon". Just as he finished muttering to himself, he heard a voice coming from the entrance</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">of the greenhouse about 50 meters behind him. Hans immediately froze, he was well aware of the fact that punishment for not obeying curfew was 3 space-hours cleaning up the shit pit, and he hated cleaning up the shit pit, because the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">shit in the pit always seemed to find a way to get into your space suit, even if those suits were supposed to be air tight. "Hans?? Is that you?" Hans let himself relax, for he could recognize that voice a kilometer away; it was his brother, Vans.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"Vans! Mein brother what are you doing out here? Do you WANT to clean the shit pit?" 
Hans ran up to his younger brother to nazi salute him. "I mean, in the name of the Fuher, how did you know I was even here?" 
"Mein brother, I hate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">to be the one to tell you, but when you get out of bed, you're louder than a jew counting his gold.. everyone in Nazi Space Base 9 could probably hear you." 
Hans was barely even paying attention to what Vans said, because he was too</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">buisy looking over Vans totally attractive body. "Vans... why are you all wet? And why are you barely wearing any clothes??" Hans suddenly became aware of the fact that his brother, like him, didn't bother to put on anything but socks</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">with little Hitler faces on them, because they both liked sleeping in the nude. 
Vans blushed, he knew that his brother spent the majority of his time in physical labor mining moon minerals to fuel the main genorator, which ran on anti semitism found</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">in little jew hating bacteria that lived in the moon rocks.
They looked at eachother very closely, and noticed how attracted they were to eachother's anti-semitism. Suddenly, in the heat of the moment, Hans grabbed Vans' socks and ripped them off,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">giving Hans full view of Vans' genetically superior feet. This gave both of them massive erections as they started to get into position to suck eachother's erections. Then, just as Hans was about to put his Aryan lips on Vans' Aryan penis, they</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">had just launched an all out invasion of the dark side of the moon, and the nazis were caught completely unprepaired for they were all sucking eachother's penises. Hans and Vans pulled up their socks and ran past hoards of other nazis who were wearing</div></div>
