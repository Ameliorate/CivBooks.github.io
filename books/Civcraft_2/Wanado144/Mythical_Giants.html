Protectors of the land







A tale told by
Wanado144</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Mt Augusta was founded partly due to the large amount of shade offered by the majestic trees that sheilded the plains from the harsh sun. Life was good, wheat grew in plenty and the city was as active as it had ever been, vibrant with culture and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">trade, always with the trees watching over. 

As time passed, and memories of what the trees did and what they stood for faded as all things do with time, youthful members saw the trees only in terms of wealth. The services they offered meant nothing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">with the prospect of some quick iron and possibly some diamonds. They took to logging the giants with a ravenous hunger that can only be made by greed. The giants fell one by one.

This murderous act</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">stretched until around half the giants had been slain. Then one morning they were gone, with no sign of where they had been.
The loggers turned to each other asking who had done all the logging and stolen more than their fair share of profits. When each</div></div>

However, bodies are good feritliser and the loggers had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">seeds in their pouches from all their harvesting. These seeds took root and started to grow. With the fertile soil they grew to a spectacular height, rivalling those of the last giant rees. WIth these new trees came newfriends. And this tale</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">is told to remind people of what the  trees are and that they are here to protect Mt Augusta, and not to be taken for granted. 

Since this day, other giant trees have appeared, some say they are the ones that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">disappeared that night coming back to the land of prosperity. Many reasons are thought why, but the generally agreed one is to see their brothers and sisters that have grown from the bodies of their enemies.</div></div>
