<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Guerrilla warfare is where a smaller unit uses certain tactics to defeat a larger opposing unit. 

Mao Zedong said  "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">This leads to the golden rule of guerrilla warfare, if things are against you, run and hide to fight again. You must always fight them on your terms.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 1: Why direct fighting doesn't work

First, it just supplies the enemy with all of your resources, a double hit as you lose them and they gain them. This just makes them stronger and you weaker, making the task even harder.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Secondly, you will always come out losing if they outnumber them. Dont fight on their terms as it will end in losing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2: Retreating and fleeing

This is a key part of the guerilla warfare, a man who flees may be a coward but he will be able to fight again. A man may die a hero but he will still lose the war. Retreating in Civcraft is basically done by logging</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">ideally with your valuables to prevent the enemy from getting them. This is a basic technique but effective if it is your valuables you wish to defend. In the case of recharge this was mostly enough as they were only around if other people were to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">oppressed and killed. However, politically motivated enemies or less PVP orientated enemies would then be able to wreck your house/city without anyone stopping them. Logging is a good quick free way for civilians to protect their goods but needs to be</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3: Fighting on your terms

Napoleon once said divide and conquer, and although it would be difficult to divide the enemy and out maneuvering people can't really work due to the small numbers. This doesnâ€™t mean you cant catch them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">divided. The way to engage in a front up attack, if you are to engage in a front up attack is on your terms and to have an almost certainty to win. Recharge divided themselves frequently into ones and twos wrecking havoc. Having one recharge member</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">running about an unknown city or one which is slightly harder to navigate than the checkerboard pattern is ideal. Your team knows how to navigate the city and should outnumber them. Ideally you would be looking to pearl them or at least waste their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">potions and armour. If the situation ever turns against you, resort to rule number one, flee!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4: Cutting the Supply

During the Recharge war the scorched earth tactic was suggested. A scorched earth tactic is where you leave nothing for enemy, food, water, medical supplies. In Civcraft terms this refers to XP, potions,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">armour and weapons. However, finding out who is supplying anyone can be difficult due to the lack of supply lines or ability to spy. However, snitching key areas or naming suspected suppliers can be effective. No supplier wants to lose business, and</div></div>
