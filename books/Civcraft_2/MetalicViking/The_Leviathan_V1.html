The pros may or may not outweigh the cons. If a state is successful, It can be called a leviathan. It is difficult to stop, and difficult to slow. 
Many cases of Leviathans fall after a very</div></div>

The people are the SOLE power of the Leviathan. They move it, they feed it, and they are it. They</div></div>

Being that the people have ability that some may not expect, it proves that the state must respect the likings of the public, as they are employed by the people to work for the people. It is more of a privilege</div></div>
