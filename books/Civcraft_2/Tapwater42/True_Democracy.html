True Democracy:
A commentary on the Tyrannical, Oligarchic, Plutocratic, Representative, and overall un-free and anti-democratic governments that dominate the politics of Civcraft.</div></div>

There are few pains in life more acute than the feeling of being excluded. Our very instincts drive us to seek inclusion through the gimmick of being "normal". From inclusion comes the pleasant social experience of</div></div>

A government that is perceived as fair is invariably one that includes all of the</div></div>

In the declarations of governments, namely laws, there is a distinction that must be made between <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>and <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de facto</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>. When a law or rule is made, it is sometimes the</div></div>

What happens in practice is, of course, important. It is not the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> government that</div></div>

That is why a "Monarchy" may be more loved than a "Democracy". It is also why a government may receive broad support up until the point</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content">that laws or regulations are actually enforced, at which time discontents will emerge to complain that others are "pulling rank".

Power is not a sword – it is a relationship between people. The word is used for many things but in relation</div></div>

Like a horse attached to a lead, law and reality always move toward each other. But which is the horse and which is the man?</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">followed. Likewise, a leader who has often shared power with those around him may face insurrection when he tries to exercise power. 

Why then, do so many members of our community content themselves with a lowly status, subordinate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">to kings and "-archs", to ministers, to all manner of autocrats and dictators? The sole reason is the desire to be normal. In the process of learning, individuals gain a limited view of the world. They see, or imagine, others living without title,</div></div>

While it is natural to think of Democracy as antithetical to tyranny, it also stands</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"opposed to unnecessary representative systems. In a community that numbers less than 100 people – even a community that numbers less than 1000 people – there is no need for representatives for any issue of internal "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"affairs. A representative would only be necessary for external representation to other communities. This is the origin of the very concept of a House of Representatives such as exists in the United States. There are many silly arguments "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content"> for the benefits of a representative system, and I cannot presciently debunk all of them, but I would like to address a few.

First, representative systems do not speed up the functioning of the Government. If the measurement is taken correctly -- from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"the beginning of planning to the final execution of plans -- there are many drawbacks and advantages to both a democratic and a representative approach to project management. Coming together as equals and sharing ideas naturally creates "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"more possibilities for good designs than leaving such work to one person. It also encourages delegation of tasks and motivates everyone to work together. On the other hand, it could encourage shirking. Furthermore, a project in which many people partici-"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"pate carries less risk than one led by a single individual, simply because if that single individual is absent for an extended period, the project will languish. Of course, a democratic system could still appoint a project manager for a specific project "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 30</a><div class="page-content">to achieve the same result as a representative system but without conferring a title and nebulously transferring power away from the citizens.

Secondly, representative systems are not "safer" than democratic ones.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Here "safe" means a political process that is difficult to usurp or abuse. Certainly, any system must have a constitution that conveys appropriate rights to people. Among these is a standard of citizenship that protects the community from a sudden influx</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 30</a><div class="page-content">of immigrants who may have different values or a differing vision from the existing community. It is simply not the case that Democracies fail in this respect. One might ask "safer for whom?" Obviously a minister or "-arch" will feel very "safe" because</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"only they are able to abuse power in a non-democratic system. But the average citizen will always fear that those above them will abuse their power. The dictator who holds all power and therefore feels fully secure, leaaves the peasantry below him with no"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 30</a><div class="page-content">choice but to pray that he will agree with and support their ideas. 

Third, representative systems do not better serve the people. So often the representative is not available and so the citizens must wait for his decision.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 30</a><div class="page-content">"Disempowered, they are unable to organize on their own.  The representative, of course, feels the convenience of not being required to consult with anyone before making a decision. Once again, the representative system only serves the representative "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 30</a><div class="page-content">better. 

In conclusion, there is no reason to accept any authority from lords, ministers, etc. Peoples should voluntarily organize to discuss issues as equals, and refuse all false and divisive titles. This is the only sensible means by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 30</a><div class="page-content">which a community ought be organized.

Therefore I call upon the lords and leaders, ministers and -archs of this land to put aside their false titles and pursue a new constitution that properly and fairly recognizes human equality.</div></div>
