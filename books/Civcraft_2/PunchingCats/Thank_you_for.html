<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 5</a><div class="page-content">Dear Keebler,

Wow, didn't really expect you to live in such a wealthy town. I thought you were simply a hermit. This lativa coorp thing seems to be going well for you. I was welcomed with a very friendly greeting from your friends TaarGas</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 5</a><div class="page-content">and afromage. They both seem like nice people. I brought you some gifts, but they seem like pocket change to you xD. I heard you are a man of great wealth in the riches of xp. This seems like a really nice town you have here. I traveled here from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 5</a><div class="page-content">Suliven, The capital of Petrania. It's about 8000 blocks away from here. To think the possibility of you finding my base was very small, the chances of you doing what you did was even smaller.  I just wanted to thank you for kind acts you have commited.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 5</a><div class="page-content">These acts surely will prosper in the hearts of those you do not think they will affect. Most likely even more then you would think. I do think I was a little crazy to travel 8000m just to hand you some small gifts, but eh, it was a fun journey.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 5</a><div class="page-content">Thank you for not griefing my shit, your anger control was, yet again, amazing. 

P.S. Tell taar I said thanks for the potions for me


            Sincerely,
           Punchingcats</div></div>
