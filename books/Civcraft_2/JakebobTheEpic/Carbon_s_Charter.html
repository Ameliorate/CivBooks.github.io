In the first iteration of Civcraft, we were able to successfully navigate the nuances of frequent power transfer. Given a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">multitude of factors as well as unique circumstances, we were unable to replicate our previous success.

<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">was drafted. It will not only detail the governing body and its function but also cnvey the values for which the city stands for. Furthermore, the provisions in this document are designed to help government and its processes get out of the way of enjoying</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">the cooperative building experience on which the city was originally founded.

And as a formality, this document shall act to succeed the original constitution. All provisions, codes, and laws, express or implied by the constitution are</div></div>

      Organization

The orginization of Carbon will be based on several basic tenets which have carried through from its founding. The essence of these</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">values can be stated most simply as the golden rule. Treat others the way you want to be treated. The end goal is to foster an environment where people are free to engage in the socioeconomic simulation of Civcraft that: a. Is without constraints on their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">political or economic choices or associations b. Is respectful of other people, their choices, their associations, and personal property. It is important to note that the reputation of Carbon is important, and while people are encouraged to engage in</div></div>

At the discretion of the city, any person who has an active charge of infringement with substantive evidence found inside the city will be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">first asked to leave or face being captured and turned over to their respective accusers. The city, based on its sole judgement, ha sthe right to refuse entry and property rights to anyone with substantive historical evidence of criminal activity.</div></div>

There will be a council that will hold the power to control the city. Its main responsibility is to oversee and plan the continued growth and development of the city whilst upholding and promoting the values on which it was founded.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">city. Basically, unless unique circumstances arise, the council will only handle the responsibilities listed above. Membership of the council will be comprised of individuals who have contributed a significant investment of time and labor to the city as</div></div>

Carbon Economic Development Cooperative

While the council oversees the big picture aspects of the city as well as future planning, its objective will be to minimize its involvement with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">operations of the city. The council will have the bulk of operations carried out by a volunteer organization, to be referred to as the Carbon Economic Development Cooperative (CEDC). The CEDC was created by design with several principles of mutualism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">All members are expected to contribute more resources than they remove, ultimately this system benefits all involved. Additionally the CEDC will conduct the building of infrastructure, gathering of resources for projects, and construction of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">city buildings. The CEDC holds no political power. Membership is encouraged, but entirely voluntary. Members are expected to promote and represent the valuse of integrity, goodwill, and respect. The main ethical code of the CEDC is "always give more than</div></div>

        Property

Private property is allowed with several conditions. Owners of property within Carbon wholly own and control all blocks from sky limit to bedrock within the boundaries of their property. To maintain</div></div>
