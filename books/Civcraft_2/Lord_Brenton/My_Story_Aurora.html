But sadly a part of it will be about the demise of the Aurora and how i casued it in many ways.  I hope to shed light on certain events that are controversial and spread my story on the server.</div></div>

Back last May 2013, my friend (Ingame name Timid_Taco) told me about the server and invited me to join, so i decided to give it a try.  On my first day my friend gave me the cords to Aurora.  So of course i decided</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 38</a><div class="page-content">to travel there.  I traveld to the cords given to me but i en up in Holy Tree.  Not knowing so i claimed a plot and started setting up.  Ohotdamn came by and advised me that this was not Aurora and that Aurora was a couple thousand blocks north.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 38</a><div class="page-content">I thanked him and quickly traveled north. I finally made it to Aurora and was amazed at the many large buildings that were built.  I was astonished a city could arise to quickly.  The people their were very nice and bao even gave me a tour.  I needed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 38</a><div class="page-content">shelter so i could get on my feet so a now inactive player Fireman_Chow showed me great kindness and let me stay in his house.  Not soon after that i aqquired a plot given to me by PepermintPig and build myself a nice little house that would eventually</div></div>

I continued to work hard and get plenty of materials.  I truly loved the people in the city and the enviroment created.  Although i was not very social</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 38</a><div class="page-content">it still seemed i got to know all the major people of the city.  Near the beginning was when the contentions between the Old Agorans and Aurorans began.  I didnt know the history behind and why it was happening  but i still payed close attention.  Becasue</div></div>

But now with my increased knowledge i can conform the opinion that the split severely damged the city.  Even with this split the city thrived and grew thanks to many great core players such as</div></div>

These players were all active and truly dedicated to the city.  Aurora entered its golden age.  In this time period I began to establish myself more as a true member</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 38</a><div class="page-content">of Aurora.  I became a police member.  I became an parliment meber for the north district and also a superintendent multiple times in the north.  I tried very hard to improve the North district which was always lacking compared to the other districts.</div></div>

The dissolution of the Federal goverment started the landslde that would destroy Aurora.  The reason behind this is becasue the federal system was meant to exist with the city government.  Getting rid of the</div></div>

Many complaints were made about our government mainly about the so called contract we had with the Lads after Doymand pearled Dill_Weasal and how they stomped all over us disobeying</div></div>

With Aurora basically abandoned and me feeling guilty for my decisions, i decided to leave.  I had so many great expeirences and met so many great people in Aurora, but it was time for me to leave.  All had been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 38</a><div class="page-content">lost.  So i made a post on the reddit officially stating my deparure.</div></div>
