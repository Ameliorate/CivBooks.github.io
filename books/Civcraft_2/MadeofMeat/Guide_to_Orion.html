Orion consists of five districts: Downtown, the Suburbs, the Green District, the Riviera, and the Olympic District.
Orion's Downtown is a dense urban area, characterized by towers and skyscrapers. The</div></div>

The Green District is a new expansion area along the city's Southern border.  Mostly unoccupied other than a few private residences.

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Geography of Orion</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Orion is situated in an expansive plains region that is broken up by many rivers and waterways.  The Orion River forms a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">northern boundary to the downtown district of the city, curving south to divide Riviera from the other districts.  South of Orion stretches the Orion National Forest, a vast biome of old-growth oak trees.</div></div>

According to legend, Orion started as a hole dug in the ground by former president Itaqi, presumably located beneath what is now the Orion Capitol building.  After the first wave of migrants developed the town's</div></div>

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Economy of Orion</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Orion's prices and wages are mildly inflated when compared to most other cities.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Both demand and supply for labor are high.  There are always new migrant laborers looking for day jobs, but it rarely takes very long for these to earn their first several diamonds working for a local businessman.

Orion's only notable agricultural products are wheat and timber, although there is also the occasional small
ranch on the city's</div></div>

By Rail:  Orion has local rail connections to nearby Haven and Harvest.  For now, Orion is also the
northernmost stop on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the Carson Railway, linking it to several major cities in the minus plus.

By Road:
If coming from the north, there is a short road connection from nearby Ancora, via Harvest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">By Boat:
If you are not served by a rail connection to Orion, your best option is likely to be travel by sea.  Travellers from the Metropolis region and the plus minus are well connected to Orion by ocean.  Be advised that the best approach is from the</div></div>

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Getting Around in Orion</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

There is a local privately owned subway system, but</div></div>

It has 6 stops that run in sort of a loop, but there are no signs and no maps.  Even local residents find it much easier to walk everywhere.  City roads are not labeled well, so we advise keeping a compass handy and</div></div>

Many tourists spend their first several hours here doing little besides running around gawking at giant buildings. The</div></div>

Don't miss seeing the Capitol Building and the HCF Monument, west of fountain plaza and just downhill from the city's rail stations. Also notable in the Downtown area are the Defiance Tower</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">project, and the Radio Orion Tower.  From the Capitol Mall area, head west across the Samuel L. Jackson Memorial Bridge into Riviera District to see Mustaphe Stadium.  With 5 fields, it is the largest spleef arena in the world.</div></div>

The Civcraft Olympics: Don't miss it!  Eleven different sports events, with contenders from all over the world.
The Orion Astros:  Even if you can't make it to a game, don't miss a chance to pop over to Riviera and have a</div></div>

Orion has an official paper currency, the</div></div>

Don't bother converting your money though; iron and diamonds are more useful for everyday transactions.  If you need to make change, National Bank in fountain plaza is the best option; they trade i for d at the official rate of 20:1.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The Orion Open-air Market is a good place to find a wide variety of shop stalls.  This is located several blocks south of the central downtown, near the base of the ivory and glass Wolf Tower building. Look for the many brightly-colored tents.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 42</a><div class="page-content">In east Downtown, Kwizzle's Ixmart is the city's best location for trading industrial goods such as xp, obsidian, gold and wood.  Tourist visitors not interested in commodity trading will find a baked potato
stall here with reasonable pricing.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the Ixmart.  Look for the sandstone building.

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Sleep</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Orion is crowded with new immigrants, and short on housing, but the coming of the Olympics has thrown the city's tourism industry into high gear. Several hotels</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 42</a><div class="page-content">are planned or are under construction at this time, and will be ready to meet demand by the time the Olympic Games start.

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Food and Drink</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

Orion mainly subsists on a diet of Harvest wheat bread. Look around the open-air</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">market for a sample of this native fare.  Another good option for food is Ixmart's baked potato stall in east downtown.
If you blew all your cash on souvenirs and knicknacks and you can't afford to eat out, the city does offer a free farm located just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">east of the fountain plaza, beside the Orion canal.  Don't forget to replant.
For drinks, we recommend visiting the Copper Tavern, an ugly wooden shack in the Suburbs district. This place also has some very plain rooms for rent, that do not have beds.</div></div>

Ever since the defeat and pearling of the griefer gang known as the "Butter Brigade," Orion has had one of the server's lowest per-capita crime rates.  No doubt this is due to its efficient and well-prepared police force, as well as to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the community-oriented mindset of its typical citizen.  Still, it pays to be smart, especially during tourist season.  Reinforce your chests and your bed, and always follow the instructions and advice of local law enforcement personnel.</div></div>

Getting tired of the city?  Take the local railway north and go sightseeing in Harvest.  A recently annexed territory of Orion, Harvest features charming stone and
red-brick houses and massive classical-styled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">marble edifices left there by the abandoned civilization of Ulaan Bataar.  In the surrounding countryside you will notice the many wheat fields that give Harvest its name and its place as the "Breadbasket of Orion".
Northwest of Harvest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">are a few extreme hills for all of you extreme climbers out there.  While you're up among the peaks, stop in at the hill-folk village for a glimpse of native Testificate culture.
Alternatively, take a hike south into the Orion National Forest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The outskirts have been deforested quite a bit, but keep going and you will soon see a breathtaking expanse of virgin oak.
