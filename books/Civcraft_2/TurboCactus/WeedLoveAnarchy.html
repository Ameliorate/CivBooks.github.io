<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">After a long night at the occupy rally, Bodhidharma420 was heading home with pleasant thoughts of ending the state. He was feeling especially rebellious and even scoffed at a facist pig giving a homeless man a drunk in public charge. "Hey you"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">he screamed from the opposite sidewalk, "Why don't you go home and beat your wife you oppressive maobamist!" He ran the rest of the way home, knowing that the facists had probably called in a hit on him for his brave words.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He made it to his one bedroom flat in record time and quickly bolted inside for fear of drone strikes. His roommate, Straightfoolish, was listening to NPR and painting the apartment red as Bodhi jumped inside. "Surprise!" Straight yelled, "do you like the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">new color?" 
Bodhi looked around at the freshly painted apartment and sighed with relief. "It's beautiful, just looking at it is making me feel so much better"

"Better?" said Straight, "What's wrong, I thought you were burning</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">bibles at the occuply rally tonight."

"I was, but a facist pig almost killed me after I stopped him from murdering a homeless man on my way home"

"Oh dear!" said Straight, "I hope that the NSA didn't follow you here!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"No, I was wearing my homemade hemp clothing, there's no way they could have planted any tracking devices."

Straight walked to the couch and pulled a small box out from under the cushions. He opened the box and showed its contents</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">to Bodhi. Bodhi's face lit up with a smile, "It's beautiful."

Straight pulled a plastic bag of weed from the box. "I bought it off of my pilates instructor."

They quickly settled onto the couch and started smoking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">the tasty Purple Indica Latino Milkshake Ride. Bodhi related the rest of the Occupy rally and Straight told him about how far he could now stick his legs behind his head. Soon, they were super baked and watching the latest King of the Hill.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Bodhi started to stare at the fresh red paint and noticed that he was getting high off of the fumes as well as the weed. His hand drifted to Straight's, as it often did, and he found comfort in his strong grasp. Bodhi and Straight had been roommates for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">many years. They had dropped out of the facist high school together and began their lives as radical anarchists. Straight fought the oppressive state by tagging bridges and handing out pamplets to children at playgrounds. Bodhi</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">often followed cops around with his cellphone and took videos of them to put on his copwatch youtube channel. They knew that they were slowly changing the world together. 

Straight suddenly gripped Bodhi's hand tightly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"What's wrong?" Bodhi asked, looking at him with concern.

Straight had tears in his eyes that couldn't have come from the paint fumes. "Bodhi... I ... just... sometimes I wonder if we could be doing more to help mother earth."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"That's crazy talk!" said Bodhi, "we're doing all we can."

Bodhi grabbed Straight's shoulders and looked into his red, irritated eyes. "Straight, we are truly making this world a better place for the future generations."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">He hugged Straight whispered "I think that you're a hero... you're my hero" 

Straight was clinging to him and wiping his snot on his itchy hemp shirt. Something about Straight's tears and the paint fumes, was arousing him like no</div></div>

Straight whispered, "I wondered when you would finally realize."

Suddenly they were both exploring with their hands. They</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">started shedding clothing. Bodhi was particularly aggressive as he ripped off Straight's pants. They started fiercely kissing each other while Bodhi shoved weed up his friends ass with his pinky finger. "Bodhi, wait. " said Straight,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">"I want you to shove the God Delusion up my ass." Bodhi tried in vain to fit the book in Straight's ass but it wouldn't fit. 

They attempted to shove more anti-facist literature in Straight's ass but nothing would fit. Neither of them ever got off and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 19</a><div class="page-content">both of them went to bed disappointed in themselves. They never attempted to have anal sex again and from then on they always kept a pillow between them in their shared bed.</div></div>
