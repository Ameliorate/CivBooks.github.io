I. Pre-Pantostado Era Old Agora</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The city of Old Agora, the ancestral home of the Agoran Federation, began as a hamlet of Anarcho-Capitalists founded soon after the start of Civcraft 1.0. Several buildings were built, among the most prominent a large incomplete tower made of stone and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">glass blocks. At some point soon after its founding, Old Agora was added to the global Civcraft maps, and was then abandoned. Old Agora lay untouched for months, simply waiting for someone to reinhabit her long empty streets.</div></div>

II. The Foundational Era</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Pantostado1066 was a relatively new Civcraft player, one with some strange beliefs and a big dream that would form the basis of what would become one of the biggest cities in Civcraft. He believed in squatting, in other words occupying abandoned</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">structures. This idea was and still is as of the time of writing somewhat novel in the world of Civcraft. The influence of the AnCaps can still be seen in all of Civcraft's structures. AnCaps believed in eternal property rights, and thus did</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">not believe in squatting. However, Old Agora had been abandoned for so long that the AnCaps who had founded it had either forgotten about it or left the server. Thus, there was no problem when Pantostado1066 moved into the ruins of the city with some IRL</div></div>

A central point of this revival was Pantostado1066's dream, which attracted several of the citizens that began to move to Old Agora, including myself. That dream was to build a University in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Civcraft, a place of learning where the knowledge of the server could be brought to be shared freely. I had spawned in the abandoned city of Mercer, and joined the history department of the Agora State University as well as constructing a museum</div></div>

As the University grew, so did the city itself. It was during this era that such notable names as NukeJay joined what would become the Federation. However, this golden age was not to last.</div></div>

III. The Agoran Republic and Al Kaowni</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Following the increase of the population of Old Agora during the Foundational Era, Pantostado1066 decided that it was time to create an Agoran government. As such, he organized a basic government under the name of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Agoran Republic. It was composed of several officials, such as the Mayor and the Dean of the University, who then voted on decisions for the Republic after being elected to their positions by the population. Pantostado1066 was easily elected as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the first Mayor of the Republic, DonVlinar as the first Senator, alpav as the first Tribune, galvan_ as the first Consul, and myself as the first Dean of the University. The new government quickly established itself, preparing for the establishment of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">an official police force and authorizing the creation of a market inside the still incomplete Agora Tower. The city grew still further as people expanded the public farms and worked to increase their wealth and establish</div></div>

However, as all Civcrafters sadly know, some people just want to watch the world burn. Al Kaowni was a group of people like that. Roleplaying Muslim terrorists, they rolled through Old Agora placing diamond</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">continued to harass the city. Because of this, the government decided that Old Agora was no longer a viable settlement location and scouts were sent out to find a new location for the population of Old Agora to escape to. It was not long before one such</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">location was found, and the Agoran Exodus began.</div></div>

V. The New Agoran Cultural Revolution</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The establishment of the Agoran Federation was an important transition in the history of Agora. Generally, it marked the creation of the pre-Breakup Agoran state as well as the establishment of the culture that would drive the growth of New</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Agora, and later Aurora, and ultimately lead to the Breakup.

<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">titles. Furthermore, the now-public nature of New Agora led to a huge population boom, giving rise to several new districts of New Agora, each with their own distinct culture within the greater Agoran culture. The Docks were known for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">their lax building codes and general slumminess, the Swamps were known for their medieval-style structures, the Hills were known for claiming to be rich, and having lots of mansions. The older portion of the city was organized</div></div>

The Farms district, as it sounds, was known for having the public farms that fed the Agoran populace and drove Agoran industry. As time</div></div>

A redstone specialist by the name of Captain_Neckbeard had moved to New Agora, and he brought with him several brilliant ideas that would jumpstart Agoran</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">industry. Firstly, he build an iron golem grinder which quickly flooded the iron and rose market throughout the city and allowed for the massive export of iron to less lucky cities. Following this marvel of engineering, he built a wood grinder</div></div>

All of this was accomplished despite the HCF War due to Agora’s policy of Neutrality at all Costs, which caused the HCF to largely ignore the city despite its burgeoning population. Several terror attacks</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were perpetrated by the Al Kaowni, however New Agora’s newfound strength allowed for these attacks to be quickly cleaned up.
