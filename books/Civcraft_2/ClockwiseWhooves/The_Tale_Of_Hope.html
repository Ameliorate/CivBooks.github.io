<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Walking...
Walking...

There is never foremore a town.

I look and wander but nothing.

I start to hear my stomach growl. I won't last long without food.w</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Walking...
Walking...

For Kilometers with no sight of civilization. None.

As the first wave of pain hits me, I start to panic. "What if i'm going to be alone" I think to myself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 42</a><div class="page-content">For the next few strikes of pain. I try to call for help. "Hello?"
"Is anyone there?"

Nothing.

I lie down in hope, tomarrow will be a better day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Two:

As I wake up, someone had moved me. 

I was standing in the middle of a Carrot Patch.

"Food. I can get somewhere now." I think to myself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 42</a><div class="page-content">As I start to pluck the carrots from the ground, I realize I have nowhere to go.

No one to help me.

No one to befriend.

So again, I start Walking...
Walking...
Walking...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Three:

It took three days of walking, Hiding from monsters, and scavenging for food,
But i found a small village.

To my dissappointment, it was abandoned.
Completely baren.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I manage to hurl myself through a window.

As I walked around inside of the ghostly house, I saw a chest.

I walk over and see that this small chest had a weak lock.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I hit the lock with a brick of stone I found, and it breaks.

Why had someone, locked a chest, Then leave?

Why did I feel as if i was being watched...?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Four:

Something was watching me. I was sure of it now. 

I started to panic, as i dashed into an, under-stairs closet.

As I slowed my breath. My heart stopped.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The first thing I saw after I entered the Closet, was a flash of blinding light.

All I knew then was pain. Horrible, Horrible pain.

Something had exploded in that dark closet. It took a moment to realize what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 42</a><div class="page-content">had happened.

"Creeper"

I think as I lay against on the the few still standing walls.

This is it. I'm going to die...

I close my eyes, and start to weep.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I'm going to be alone... again. No one to even
talk to.
All alone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Five:

I wake up, I hadn't moved at all. I still lay in the broken, ghostly house.

I still can barely move, but i manage to pull myself over the the small chest.

As i open it, the first</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">thing I see, it a Vial.

This vial, had a redish, colored look to it.

Should I drink it?

I decide the worst that could happen is spontaneous combustion, so i drink the concoction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Six:

I feel strong now.

Stronger than i have ever felt in my life.

I take a sword from the chest, and walk out of the broken wall.

Nightime.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I look over and notice a figure.

As i try to get a closer look an arrow flies by my face.

I yell as i charge towards the figure.

I bring my sword down upon the figure.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">As it stumbles back, i see that it has no flesh whatsoever.

Skeleton.

I swing my sword again, ending the monster's undead life.

I start walking once again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Seven:

The night passes and the sun rises.

Through the night i had walked several kilometers.

I was standing in a plains biome.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">As i look around i notice a pig, with a Saddle!

I hop ontop of the pig, and fashion myself a fishing rod, from a spider i had defeated during the night.

I hook a carrot on
and put it infront of the pig.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">he starts to move.

A few days had passed until the pig came to an abrupt stop.

Hell.

Hell itself had leaked into the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">While i am taking a look around the edge, i hear an explosion.

I run back to where i had left, Carl, my pig,
to find nothing but his corpse.

The only friend that i had. Gone. Forever...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Epilouge:

I had lost Carl, i didn't want to continue on without him, but I knew I must.

I struggle for the next few days, once again I was all alone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I didn't have a meaning to go on, other than the fact that i promised Carl i would find us a Home. even if it had meant, that he wouldn't be there with me.

Walking...
Pain... Hunger...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">These thing were all that I knew.

That is, until i heard someone in the distance. The pain, and hunger seemed to fade away. As i ran, faster and faster, my heart about jumped straight out of my chest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I had found Civilization. I had done what i promised to Carl...

They gave me a bed.
Food. Shelter...

There was only one thing I still had to do. And thats why i left...

To avenge Carl.</div></div>
