<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 15</a><div class="page-content">It is my opinion that this server has been a resounding success, as far as its goals of modeling civilization go. It has successfully modeled human nature, in multiple situations and times. Already, the rise and fall of civilization(s) has been modeled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">successfully, and with surprising accuracy.

Take for example, what I'll refer to as the Golden Age. This was the start of the server, when cities rose from the wilderness and an entire world was connected by fast transport. Trade</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">flourished, and so did the cities that became nexus of trade. They grew larger, more complex, richer.

But all things must come to an end. The HCF played the part of many barbarians before them, striking cities and trade routes, leveling</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">buildings and monuments renowned the world over. They killed and pillaged, and burned and looted. They, among other things, caused the destruction or abandonment of multiple cities. The World Police fell before them, and with it the last vestiges</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">of a world wide civilization.

People began to run into the wilderness to hide, or to the more militant and/or secret cities. Civilization collapsed in large swaths of land,relatively over night. New towns and villages were settled</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">in the wilderness, many of the old roads and cities abandoned. In some of them, squatters took up residence, while others stayed eerily silent.

So, what does this successfully model? Well, it models a few things quite well. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The game starts, cities are built, trade established. Certain cities become the centers of trade because of their position. This models real world trade in the days before cars and planes really well.

But some of the best modeling came from,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">ironically, the fall of civilization. As we know from our own history, wherever there is a great concentration of wealth, prestige, or power someone will rise to try and take it. Look at what happened in Rome, and what the Mongols did in China.   The HCF</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">were this server's Mongols and Vandals. They came and raided the cities, took the wealth that had first attracted them. When they came, people fled. This too is an accurate model. When a feared force comes, people have a tendency to run. This happened all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">over the server.

Now, there are continual rumblings of a "Resistance." However, it never seems to gain enough steam to succeed because people don't seem to care enough.

This is an accurate model as well. We have a tendency to take the "sit by and do nothing" attitude when the situation doesn't affect us, and that is what is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">happening here. What's more, people don't want to risk loosing all that they own after dying. That's even more of a concern here, because after death/imprisonment the player has to struggle though life in the End.

There is one more suprisingly accurate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">model. Look at what recently happened to Mt Augusta. McFluffyKittens attempted to take the city over by force. Note the words "take over." It wasn't a simple attempt to destroy, or simply raid. It was an attempt CONQUER. Here, we see something like what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">the Vandals and Mongols did. They raided, and raided, and raided until they started to conquer. Then, they built up their own kingdoms after carving up the older civilizations there. That is what is happening here.

Of course, time may</div></div>
