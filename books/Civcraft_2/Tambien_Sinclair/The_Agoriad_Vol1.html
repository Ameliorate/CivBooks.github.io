I. Pre-Pantostado Era Old Agora</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The city of Old Agora, the ancestral home of the Agoran Federation, began as a hamlet of Anarcho-Capitalists founded soon after the start of Civcraft 1.0. Several buildings were built, among the most prominent a large incomplete tower made of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">stone and glass blocks. At some point soon after its founding, Old Agora was added to the global Civcraft maps, and was then abandoned. Old Agora lay untouched for months, simply waiting for someone to reinhabit her long empty streets.</div></div>

II. The Foundational 
Era</div></div>

seen in all of Civcraft's structures. AnCaps believed in 
eternal property rights, and thus did not</div></div>

forgotten about it or left the server. Thus, there was no problem 
when Pantostado1066 moved into the ruins of the city with</div></div>

was Pantostado1066's dream, which attracted several of the citizens that began to move to Old Agora, including myself. That</div></div>

in the abandoned city of Mercer, and joined the history department of the Agora State</div></div>

joined what would become the Federation.</div></div>

III. The Agoran Republic and Al Kaowni</div></div>

Old Agora during the 
Foundational Era, Pantostado1066 decided that it was time to create an Agoran government. As such, he organized a basic government under the name of the</div></div>

several officials, such as the Mayor and the Dean of the University, who then voted on decisions for the Republic after being elected to their positions by the 
population. Pantostado1066 was easily elected as</div></div>
