While devotions are of course, always given to Aztlan, they take a different path than devotees of other, lesser gods.

But what kind of god is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Aztlan, exactly? The ancient texts do not specifically refer to a gender, so we cannot make inferences on whether Aztlan is male, female, or something else entirely.

There are no graven images of Aztlan in the texts, and descriptions of him or her vary</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">wildly.

And so, a such, we cannot put a face to the name. All we do know of Aztlan's appearance is that he is said to "Reflect the Day's Warmth," and "Mimics the Moon and Stars."

With such a vague description, it makes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">identification uniquely difficult.

I have now spent three weeks researching the hidden Cult, the one that had been believed to have died out ages ago. But one that I believe may still be in operation.</div></div>

In the forests south of the capitol, Roma, and to the north of the Port City, I have made my home at Camp Quirinus.</div></div>

Is it there I might find the answers I seek?

Will I know of Aztlan's</div></div>

Nonetheless, I shall record my experiences. I only hope that if I do find the Cult of Aztlan, and if they persist after all these years, that it won't lead to my demise.</div></div>
