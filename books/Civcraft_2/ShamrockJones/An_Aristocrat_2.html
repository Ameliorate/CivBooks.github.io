Many new citizens have flocked to Gondolin!  Colt, KnifeThrower, and Chrono have all bought plots within the District.  Each has different skills, and each looks to be a strong addition to our city.</div></div>

The vandals ran when we got there, they called themselves the "Black Knights" as they ran into the woods.  We hunted</div></div>
