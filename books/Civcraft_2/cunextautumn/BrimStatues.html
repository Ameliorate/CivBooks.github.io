<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">I ventured to the Brimstone city nearby noted for its beuty to study its statues so that I might replicate one for the Chiron Sculpture in Centaur Square.

While in town I thought I'd write of the skilled sculptors of Brimstone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Brimstone Stallion:

This sculpture was the destination of my trip, in order to create the Centaur. Studying the statue one is overcome by the intricate beauty in the simplicity of it.

The Sculpture is made of but 2 materials</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">and yet the exact image of a stallion with legs raised has been created.

Starting from the feet we have hooves of Netherbrick, staggered yet firmly planted on the pedestal.

Its flanks are made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">of quartz blocks and stairs, to form legs 8m high from hoof to hip.

The torso of the Stallion is only one block wide, yet the definition created by use of stairs gives the illusion of a much wider sculpture.

The forelegs stretch</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">outward 6m and end in Netherbrick slabs, and downward turned feet.

The head, which will not be used in the Chiron statue is non-theless impressive. Neck, nose, mouth, and even eyes are portrayed using a combination of slabs, stairs, and chizeled quartz.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The mane is of netherbrick and ends in a long tail to tie the statue together well.
The sculptor is of exquisite skill.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">King Fred I:

King Fred, or "Fucking Freddie" is an austaire quartz and netherbrick lion in the supine position.

Much like the stallion its beuty rests somewhere between simplicity and complexity. Its wide</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">paws haunches and tail make for a stable base that allows for a realistic center of gravity to be established.

This sculptures body ranged from 8-6m wide depending on where the measurements are taken.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Its mane of netherbrick accents and draws focus to the face which looks surprisingly lion-like despite being just a quartz block with a stair on top.

The beuty of Brimstone's sculptures is in their ingenious use of limited shapes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">space and textures to fool the eye into seeing exactly what the artist wants portrayed. In this case, not a pile of blocks, but a Stallion and a Lion.</div></div>
