This town is in serious disrepair. Grass grows untamed on the floors of most houses. Broken windows, broken walls, and broken locks are commonplace. In one old wooden house I found scrawled on the arms of a chair "Dis Dick." "Dat Dick."</div></div>

The Town Center is defined by a mossy fountain filled with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">stagnant water, teeming with insects. From the fountain radiates multiple roads to the larger buildings in town, most likely owned by the higher status residents.

Heading further down the road i nearly fell to my death in a giant stripmine pit, future</div></div>

Pit mining appears to be common place as many uncovered deep pits dot the landscape.

After some scrounging in the dirt I found an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">old wooden sign:

and another:

"New Leningrad

Date Opened, 12-28-13"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It can be inferred that these mines were actually dug by and operated by New Leningard miners in their search for stone and ore, and fairly recently as well.

The crowning feature of Oasis is its river spanning bridge, which also appears new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">and in the style of New Leningrad architecture. Sure enough, a dilapidated stone bridge can be seen spanning the river a little ways down.

Once again it can be inferred that New Leningrad built the new bridge to</div></div>

The Mines:
After travelling upon the surface I decided to take a look in the Leningrad mines here.
They are simple pit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">mines all the way to bedrock. The newer one had a small workers station with a locked door and a small window. In the window a desk, work bench, smelter, and chest is visable.

Through a crack in the wall I was able to enter the work statio</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">and confirmed that were 3 smelters, a work bench, a double chest, and a single chest. All locked.

The second mine is much larger but also much shallower. Nothing of interest was found in this mine, and one wonders why it was vitrified.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Farms:
There was only one area in town that looked to be a farm.
Some old stems and melon seeds seem to imply that the Oasians lived off a watermelon heavy diet. 

The farms are old, but some areas remain tilled. Yearning for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">seed and water to grow food once again.

All other buildings in town are too distroyed to gather much information from. The damage appears to be cause by a fire that spread quickly in the mostly wooden town.</div></div>
