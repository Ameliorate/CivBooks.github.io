By: CUNextAutumn</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Society is built upon three pillars.

The Workers
The Artists
The Exploitors

The workers are the silent majority, constantly toiling to support themselves, and when possible others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">In modern society the working class is exploited by the wealthy who contribute nothing but a means to organize and utilize the working class.

The artists, unlike the workers are able to contribute to society as a whole doing what they love. Whether it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">be construction, writing, physical art.

But if the worker loves what they do then they too can be artists. An artist in the fields, an artist in the factory, or an artist in their mines.

The worker can only become an artist if</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">he can break free from the shackles of the exploiter class.

The only way that one can become an artist and love what they do is to be in a society that does not exploit their working class.

In this sense we whisk away the need for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">coercive labor and have a voluntary civilisation. If noone tells you what you MUST do you can develop what you WANT to do. 

In this way, all members of society contribute to society. No small percentage get wealthy off the backs</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">of others so long as all members contribute what they can.

One way that Cetaur Socialism expedites this voluntary state is by automating labor where possible.

The less time needed for tedious repetetive tasks, the more time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">that can be spent on the things that make the citizen happy.

The highest goal of Centaur Socialism is a society of happy citizens who have as much fun as possible in their day to day lives. 

In this way, happy citizens</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">interact with other happy citizens. It reduces conflict and creates a feeling of security and comradery that builds the foundation for a social family.

When a Centaur citizen can for certain say that all members of his city are happy, then</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">they are in a functioning Centaur City.

A well rounded and successful Centaur City is one that draws on a plethora of artists.

The wider variety of people who do what they love increases</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">the diversity of the fruits of their art. You need the artist in the mines to bring stone for the architect. You need the artist in the fields to provide exp for the sword dancer. 
A complete society is one with no gaps in this mesh of citizens.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">No private property, just friendly neighbors doing what they love for the good of each other.

This is the goal of Centaur Socialism.</div></div>
