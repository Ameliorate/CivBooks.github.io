Being welcomed to a place like this is amazing! There can't be more 'welcomeness' in a place like this! In the next pages I explain you why!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Imagine.... 

You spawn in a world without knowing anything about it. You are lost and don't know what to do. And suddenly there was a Romec, asking: 'what are your co√∂rdinates?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">From that moment on I felt welcome to Civcraft! He told me exactly where to go in this open world with danger.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After a explaination how to find the nearest train station I started my journey! Luckily I was somehow supplied with resources: Bread torches and tools.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After a long walk following the instructions of my guide I found the train station that would lead me to the save lands.
I walked to the right platform to take the first leaving train(minecart).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">The trainjourney took a lot of my time and energy. It was almost dawn and I wasn't even halfways. I was exausted but knew that giving up on reaching the save lands wasn't an option.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Following the instructions of my guide while being close to a collapse was hard to do. The cold breeze through the trainshafts made me shiver.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">The guide told me to change train on the next station. Where the train track was was nothing more then just a question mark for both of us. It took hours to find the right platform but eventually I made it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Another long journey by train was ahead. I felt weak, my legs where shaking and sweat dripped down into my lap. Although I was resolute to survive in this bare world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Suddenly the train track changed direction! 'The guide told me about this change of direction' was the first thing that came up in my mind. I was getting closer to my destination, the meeting point! It gave me some hope and a little energy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">I knew and I waited and stare into the deep tunnel. It seemed like it was never ending. Just untill I saw a little bright spot all the way in the distance! Just that moment I was sure I made it!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">My guide gave me some food and offered a help. After I regained strength we walked through the hexagon where he showed me around. We even visited a theatre with some great live music! I had such a wonderfull time there!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After we had alot of fun in the hexagon we took a more comfortable train to tellahassee! The trip was tollarable. relative to the train journeys I took in the past few days.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Just when we arrived I was feeling home! Romec gave me some supplies to start with! I was allowed to build on his land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">After I built my house he showed me around in the city. A great place with a lot of oportunities to work and start out as a newcommer!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">What I did the next weeks was working for diamonds under healthy circumstances. I chopped wood, gathered sugar canes and vines and even started building a bridge for the community.
It earned me enough to keep myself save in this bare world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 17</a><div class="page-content">One thing I am sure about! That is: without my guide I didn't make it. So to end this story I want to say one thing:

'Thank you Romec'
