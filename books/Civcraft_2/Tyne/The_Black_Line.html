<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"There was a time, once, when I lived in the grand city of Mount Augusta. I\u0027d always enjoyed the proximity and diversity that came with a city of its stature and age, but in city folk there\u0027s always a desire to take a break from din and hurry of the big"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"city. When such an urge came over me, I found myself yearning for the rolling hills and friendly faces of Sinsylvannia, a small town wherein I\u0027d rested at a rail stop years prior. In looking for this township on the map of rail lines, however, I was"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"unsuccessful. I decided, therefore, to contact an old acquaintance that I\u0027d known to have overseen the construction of many of Mount Augusta\u0027s rail lines. He lived in a sooty brown apartment building, and, having no current employment, invited me to meet"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"him there to try to locate my Sinsylvannia. When I entered, my first sense was that of the rank smell of the place: a smell that may be most accurately described as that of wet, rocky compost. Once we\u0027d exchanged pleasantries and caught one another up, I"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">made an attempt at practical conversation.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"So," I begin, warily, "with the understanding that you have of the rails under Augusta, I'm sure you know just about every stop on just about every line."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He beamed proudly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Well, I believe I can safely say</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">that I'm just about as knowledgeable as a man can get on the matter."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A look of perturbation came across his face briefly, then faded to staidness as he added,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Other than, perhaps, the workers themselves."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Regardless, I'm sure that you can help me find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">what I'm searching for," I continued.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'd like to know where a small town on the yellow line is. I know for certain that it's on the western portion."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>At this, he relaxed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Well, there are plenty of towns on the yellow line. Do you remember the name of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">it?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"If I recall, it's known as Sinsylvannia."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For an awkward moment after its mention, the fellow seemed to look directly through me with a hatred so searing that I was unsure if he would allow the parlance to continue. When the moment passed,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">he blinked wildly, angrily, and avoided eye contact as he began to speak again.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Where did you hear of that town?" he questioned, slowly but firmly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I chuckled, although I know I shouldn't have.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I've been there, a while ago. I'd like to go there again</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">if I can find a way."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"There is no way," he barked assuredly.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Surely, there must be some way to go there on the yellow line. I've been there."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Damn your yellow line, and damn your having been there!" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He took a moment to regain his composure.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">I wasn't frightened of the man, for I'm quite large myself, but I'd have been a fool not to concern myself of his being.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Are you alright? Would you like that I get you some water?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"No, no," he replied, dazed, "I'll be fine."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He rubbed his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">forehead with a calloused hand, whilst appearing to silently mouth something to himself.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"If it's such trouble, I could always just consult. . ." I trailed off as he lifted his head.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"You simply won't give up, will you?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Well," I replied</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">sheepishly, "it was a lovely town."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He paused for a moment, sitting up.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Then I'll show you the line, and from there it's your responsibility."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>We arrived at the rail station at an hour or so past midnight, as he insisted that the line was only</div></div>

Once in the rail station, I followed him for what seemed like half an hour, until he finally came to a halt. There before us was an iron door, and surrounded by it was obsidian of a reddish hue, the likes of which I\u0027d never seen"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"before. He hesitated a moment before advancing and pulling a lever beside the door, opening it with a rusty creak. He then gestured grimly for me to enter, as the undertaker may an aged man to his coffin. I stepped through the door and into the darkness"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">of the tunnel.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I was cut off by the sharp creak of the door shutting. No sooner had the door closed than I had heard a most obscene and disturbed wailing from behind it. The tunnel around me was unlit, and I, having no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"source of light, found myself groping at the walls as my eyes adjusted. When they did, I was able to discern the makeup of my surroundings. The walls of the tunnel were of the same reddish obsidian as surrounded the door, stretching out as far as I could"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 25</a><div class="page-content">see. On the ground, no rail was laid; however, there was a single sign which, upon further inspection, bore the name of the tunnel:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"THE BLACK LINE."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Disconcerted with my position and the bizzare flight of my acquaintance, I nonetheless decided there was</div></div>

As I advanced, I found myself frequently glancing over my shoulder, in fear that something may have "</div></div>

The tunnel went on, and I walked through it for what seemed to be hours, until I felt that I needed to take a moment to recollect my thoughts and rest my weary feet.

As I admired it, one particular part of the wall caught my eye. I got up and walked over to it to get a closer look. It was what appeared to be a carving of a femur in the wall of the tunnel. It"</div></div>
