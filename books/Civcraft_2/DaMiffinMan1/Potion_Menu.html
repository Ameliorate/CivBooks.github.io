<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Lilac Lager
(Mundane Potion)
The Wilted Lilac's original Lager. It won't heal you. It won't hurt you. It won't do much of anything. But it's cheap, tastes fantastic, and it gets you drunk. What else do you need?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Wilted Lager
(Potion of Weakness)
This is just a Lilac Lager done wrong. I made a lot of these back when I was a newbie brewer. (brewbie?) I just sell them to get them out of my face.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Silence
(Milk)
This isn't a potion. It's just milk. But this milk gets rid of all effects you may get from my drinks. Good effects and bad effects alike.
How?

...Cow magic.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Imaginary Friend
(Potion of Invisibility)
This drink'll make you invisible. You gotta take your armor off to be fully invisible, though. It's great for playing tricks on people and sneaking around. 2spooky</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Cura Syrup
(Healing Potion)
A great-tasting drink for anyone who had an unfortunate encounter on the way here. Repairs all your screwed up limbs and organs so you can break them some more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Wandering Whiskey
(Potion of Poison)
It's special ingredient is the venom of the Brazilian Wandering Spider. Surprisingly, it tastes good. It still hurts like hell. Luckily, I watered it down enough so that it won't kill you. You're welcome.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Liquid Nails
(Potion of Harming)
Some people eat bowls of nails for breakfast, without any milk. But then I thought, "What if... the nails WERE the milk?!" I've been killing people ever since.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Adrenaline Ale
(Potion of Swiftness)
The main ingredient is actual adrenaline. None of that medicinal stuff. I take it straight from the unsuspecting victim!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Torch Tonic
(Potion of Night Vision)
It's like you have two little torches in your eyes, lighting the way! Well, that's because there is. Magic is swell, isn't it? You might feel a bit of a burning sensation in your eyes. It's probably harmless.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Magma Malt
(Potion of Fire Resistance)
Made from those silly Magma Cubes. It's said to make you impervious to fire and lava. Does it? Hell if I know! If you wanna go throw yourself in lava to test it, be my guest!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Lead Belly
(Potion of Slowness)
This drink settles in your stomach and quickly solidifies into a nice chunk of brick. Good luck going anywhere with THAT in your stomach! And good luck going to the bathroom, too.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Falcon Punch
(Potion of Strength)
NAAANAANANAAANAANAANAAANAANANAAAAAANAAAANAAANAAAAANAANAAANAANAAANAANANAAAAAANAAAAANAAANAAANAANAAAAANAAANAANAAAANAAANAAANAAAAAAANAAAANAAANAANAAANAAANAANAANAAANAANAAANAAA
SHOW ME YOUR MOVES!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Scuba Smoothie
(Potion of Water Breathing)
This'll let you breathe underwater. The main ingredient is a pufferfish, and if not brewed correctly, this drink could kill you. Did I mention I've never made these before?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Holy Tears
(Potion of Regeneration)
This drink is amazing! It'll make you slowly regenerate your health for a little bit! I could punch you in the face and it would be fixed in seconds! ...Hey, come here, lemme try that...</div></div>
