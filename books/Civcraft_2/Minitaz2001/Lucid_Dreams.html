Guarding their fortress in the dead of night as only the bone white moon cast a leery eye upon them. The wind rustled the dried and dead fall leaves, scratching at my ear and</div></div>

But it didn't last, the darkness of the forest faded and in moments the sun beamed brightly down, my eyes squinting as the rays of</div></div>

Light was now everywhere, the white blindness just as horrifying as the black night. The air was so parched, so dry and blistering that I felt as if my body were disintegrating into the sand itself.</div></div>

I was always in control of the dreamscape, ALWAYS. But now, here in this reality,  I found myself powerless as some THING shifted my landscape like flipping</div></div>

I had to get out, I had to get back in MY dreamscape.
...
Ever since I was a small child, I loved going to sleep. Most parents argued with their children to get them to climb in, close their eyes and let their body and mind</div></div>

At first I thought it was normal to I would awake in the dreamscape, I always knew it was the world of dreams by my sudden ability to fly or use my superpowers or</div></div>

I told my parents about this and they always brushed it off. I would tell friends, family members and strangers in the doctor's or dentists office about my amazing dream world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">My parents would gently nudge me then give the person a big smile, "She has an active imagination." And the two would chuckle and I knew that was my cue to be quite and not mention my nightly adventures. As I grew older, the power to control my dreams</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">became effortless. While some kids left the dream world behind, I became infatuated with mine, obsessed even. By the age of 13 I knew all about lucid dreaming , I was studying Jung dream theories by 16 and decided to double major in humanities and</div></div>

Now I stumbled through the deep sand trying desperately to find some sort of shelter. But just as my foot hit the sand water splashed and continued to swell upward,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">past my knees and hips, up to my chest and shoulders until I was choking on the salty liquid. Waves crashed over my head and sent me down into a deep blue as I thrashed and churned. The swishing sounds of the ocean encased me, my world glowed deep blue</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">and the depths of the ocean began swallowing me whole. I could usually breathe under the water in my dreams, but here I was as helpless as I was during the wake of day. I tried sucking in oxygen, tried desperately to believe it would be sweet air</div></div>

The darkness grew and I felt myself fading, I knew I was going to die here. I was going to be MURDERED in a dream that was not my own. I heard the soft swishing of waves, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">could feel the life leaving me when the small chuckle crept from within my own mind.
"I'm disappointed, Eliza. I thought you were truly worthy, my God how wrong I was!"
I snapped awake and went to gasp for air, only to find myself in the midst of sleep</div></div>

But I knew I was still in that things grasp, it was toying with me. I was a mouse with a broken spine, but still alive and conscious as those big cat eyes stared at me hungrily,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content"> ready to taste my blood, take my life.
There it was, the shadow figure. It always lurked when I was frozen in the timeless place. The theory was it was our fear manifesting as a cultural archetype, the humanoid shape we knew so well with the</div></div>

My vision was blurry, I could only see a pinhole of my white, swirled plaster ceiling and the shadow figure on my left. My eyes were opening more now, the slowly swinging ceiling fan came into view, the shadow</div></div>
