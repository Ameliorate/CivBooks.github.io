The hcf had only returned a week ago but had already carved a trail of destruction through the world, and now they were upon Orion. A small group of soldiers had stepped forward to try and defend"</div></div>

As the hordes of griefer scum appeared on the horizon, the heroes drank their potions and charged forward. They met outside the city, and started fighting.

He charged and struck malice in the chest, knocking him to the ground. Just as the brute was about to plunge his sword"</div></div>

Malice turned his head to see what had happened, and standing there was Itaqi, holding his bow, named after the same hero that his city was. He was standing tall, and seeming"</div></div>

Upon seeing this, the hcf retreated vowing to strike again another day. The Orionites cheered, some returning to the city to celebrate, some helping themselves to the loot of the fallen."</div></div>

Itaqi pulled a little too hard, however, and Malice fell into his arms, giving him an embrace. He quickly stepped back and blushed. “Thanks” he said. “No problem” Itaqi replied. He turned and"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">started walking back to the city, malice quickly followed him.
“Hey, how about we get a drink?” He said “It’s on me, you saved my life”.
“Thanks, but I can’t” Itaqi said “I appreciate the offer but I can’t imagine doing something like that with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">anyone besides her, and she’s moved on”
A look of sadness overcame him as he was forced to relive the memories of his sweet abandoning him. Malice opened his mouth to say something but decided against it. They came to a split in the road. Itaqi</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 25</a><div class="page-content">went one way, Malice went the other.
The next day Malice went to the fusilado pancake house for breakfast. He ordered the Belgian special, and as he was returning his menu to the waiter, he spotted Itaqi in a booth. He was eating a cheeseburger,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"and drinking hot chocolate. The way the sun shone through the window made him look even more heavenly than the last time Malice saw him, and he thought he was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. His short brown hair and stubble"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">matched perfectly with his sun-kissed honey skin. Malice had a crush on Itaqi sense he first saw him when he arrived in the city, and he never imagined that he would ever be in his presence. He ran over to Itaqis booth and sat down.
“Hi” he said. “I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot yesterday. I’m Malice, I just want to thank you for saving my life.”
“No problem” Itaqi replied. “But like I already said, I still don’t think I’m able to open up myself to feelings like that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 25</a><div class="page-content">again”.
Itaqi knew Malices feelings when he looked in his eyes; it was the same look that she used to give him. It pains him to remember that. After the event he wasn’t able to leave his house for months, and his sobbing could be heard from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 25</a><div class="page-content">streets. He’s recovered somewhat sense then, and now he spends most of his time carrying a hollow feeling in his chest.
“Please” malice said, “give me a chance, how about we go on just one date, and after that you can decide whether or not you want to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 25</a><div class="page-content">see me again”
“I don’t know” Itaqi said
The waiter placed Malices food in front of him. He smiled and said “this can be the date”. Itaqi smiled back, it had been the first time he felt happiness in months. “okay” he said, “one date.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">They had been going out for three months. This was their fifth date, and Malice invited Itaqi to his house for this one.
He knocked on the door, and malice opened wearing a bath robe. “Come in” he said. Itaqi was speechless and did as he was told. “I</div></div>

He pulled off his robe and revealed his black lingerie to him. Itaqis moth hung open in shock. Malice smirked and grabbed Itaqis hand, pulling him into the bedroom. He got on the bed and on"</div></div>

He pulled it to the side showing him his warm, moist, asshole. “Eat up” He said. Itaqi brought his face to it and started moving his tongue around the rim before plunging it in and gave it a passionate kiss. Malice"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">"moaned in pleasure. Upon hearing that Itaqi lost all control and started took off his clothes, exposing his monstrous penis. Malice saw that and started salivating. “It looks like your little guy needs some attention”. He quickly turned around and put"</div></div>

He used his tongue to move around the head, licking the pre-cum off the tip before going deeper. Itaqi moaned, making Malice work even harder. Itaqi grabbed Malices head and thrust himself all the way in before cumming"</div></div>

He hadn’t released in months, and there was so much of it that it started to spill out of Malices mouth onto his chest and chin. Malice fell back. “That was incredible” he said.
