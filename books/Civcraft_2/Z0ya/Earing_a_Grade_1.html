<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 43</a><div class="page-content">“Alright everyone, settle down.”
The teacher’s voice silenced the murmurs in the classroom. He took his seat, pulled it forward, and
waited for the class’s full attention before he spoke. He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 43</a><div class="page-content">looked down between his legs, where his
over-achieving teacher’s pet stared back up at him, blushing red.
---
The day before, that same student had approached him after class, concerned about his grade.
“I need an A in this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 43</a><div class="page-content">class!” he explained, but the teacher shook his head.
“There’s simply no way, at this point. It’s simply impossible.”
“What about extra credit?” asked the boy, desperately. It’s exactly what the teacher wanted to hear.
---</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 43</a><div class="page-content">
He looked down at the boy in his extra credit outfit, making his extra credit pouty face. Then, he pulled
down his zipper, and pulled out the boy’s extra credit assignment.
The boy was looking up at him, defiantly. Fair enough,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 43</a><div class="page-content">thought the teacher, I never said he had to do it
with a smile. He looked back up at the class, and placed a hand on his student’s face.
“Open up” he said, loudly and offset, “to page sixty-eight of your book.” He glanced down at the boy,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 43</a><div class="page-content">looking
up at him with fire in her eyes.
“Can we get a reader? It’s a shame that he isn’t here today, or we could all benefit from his big mouth
for once,” he said, and scooted forward in his chair. To every other student, it looked as if he was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 43</a><div class="page-content">just
adjusting his seat, but to him, it meant a cock in the mouth.
The student panicked, but tried not to make a sound. He pulled back, his lips gliding over the shaft,
leaving it wet, but before he pulled far enough away to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 43</a><div class="page-content">pop it free completely, a hand stopped him. He
was on the tip again, his neck arched as back as it would go, and the hand insisted that he return from
where he came, rather than retreat any further. The teacher held in a moan as he felt his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">student
sucking on the end; a compromise that didn’t involve moving too much. Still, the teacher urged him
forward, demanding a proper blowjob. He reluctantly obliged, and the forbidden blowjob started inearnest.
The boy worked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">without a sound if he could, and with a *gwark* or a *glurg* or a *gurk!* if he couldn’t.
The other students wondered where the sound was coming from, but none suspected that their fellow
student was under the desk, fellating</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">the teacher. The boy had begged him to let him do it before class
started, but he’d told him to hide under the desk and wait for his classmates to assemble, or he’d fail
the assignment. Behind him, all his classmates sat, and in front of him sat his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">teacher, and in his mouth
was his teacher’s penis, slick with his saliva, getting the deluxe treatment from his lips. He pressed his
face into the teacher’s crotch while the cute girl that sat behind him read from the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 43</a><div class="page-content">textbook, unaware
that he was the one putting the smile on their teacher’s face.
It went on like that for a few minutes, as the blowjob was slow and steady, lest it start to become loud
and sloppy. The teacher had given them a new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 43</a><div class="page-content">assignment while he was giving his precious student his
cock, orally. A student in the back had started to complain that the essay being assigned had two
options, and that they should get extra credit for completing both.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">
“I did offer an extra credit assignment to one student, which he is… nearly done with, but that was a
special circumstance, and… that’s all I’ll say about it.”
“That’s not fair! He’s so lucky.”
The teacher looked down at the boy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">working diligently at blowing him, and nodded his head. “I don’t
think if you were in his position you would be saying that.”
It wasn’t the first time he considered biting down on his teacher’s happy-stick, but it was the first time
that he looked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 43</a><div class="page-content">up at him with hateful eyes. Not that it mattered; by all indications, he was passing his
oral examination with flying colors, as the teacher became steadily less able to hide his arousal and
pleasure, moaning whenever he deepthroated him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">or licked the underside or sucked strongly.
Each time he did, he considered chomping down as a corrective measure, but knew that would end with
his teacher yelping, knocking the desk over, and revealing him on his knees, dressed as a girl,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content">with
precum dribbling down his lips.
And that wasn’t the only thing. As had happened many times before, he had an embarrassing problem
of his own, and it wouldn’t go away. Not only wouldn’t his erection go down,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">the more it rubbed at the
panties and the skirt, the more it stiffened. It was the worst possible time for one… and he worried it was
going to get even worse. Every time he thought about what he was doing, or what was in his mouth, it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 43</a><div class="page-content">
jerked, and rubbed even more… until finally, it felt just like it did all those times right before he was in dire
need of a tissue, and he pulled his skirt tightly over it as he deep throated the teacher to distract him.
It felt like a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 43</a><div class="page-content">sudden sneeze into the tissue of his skirt as his body betrayed him. He shuddered as he
came, focusing more on the messy accident in his underwear than on the thing in his mouth. He was
surprised when he realized that he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 43</a><div class="page-content">was spitting more than the time he looked up lesbians online, even
though it felt tingly where he was pressed up against the fabric of the panties, thoroughly soaking them
with semen that bubbled between the weave. How was he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 43</a><div class="page-content">going to explain to his sister what caused the
stain on the clothes he borrowed from her? He tried not to moan, but he couldn’t help whimper. He
knew that the skirt and certainly the panties were going to be irrevocably ruined when he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 43</a><div class="page-content">felt it dribblingout between the weave of the fabric, pooling onto the floor. With a final shudder, he finished, and his
underwear had never felt more sticky. Finally, his boner went down, having spent itself, but it was
difficult to take solace in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">that, knowing that if anyone saw his skirt now, they’d know he had a boner in it,
and that problem had solved itself.
If his teacher noticed, he didn’t show it. He’d been holding back a moan since he felt his cock suddenly
buried in a throat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 43</a><div class="page-content">And what’s more, once the boy resumed his movements, he had to concentrate on
holding back something else, as well. The boy felt him twitching and jerking in his mouth, his cock
getting harder even than it’d been before, and knew what that reaction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 43</a><div class="page-content">meant. He pulled himself back;
there was no way the two of them could hide THAT particular event, but the teacher slid his chair
forward even more, trapping him between his thighs. The boy tried to push him away, but couldn’t
budge him. The boy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 43</a><div class="page-content">looked up at him, pleading, but his teacher rigidly faced forward, addressing the
class, while he started to thrust into his mouth by shifting his seat back and forth subtly.
“And, with that, I think it’s about time I dismissed class…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 43</a><div class="page-content">But first, in lieu of our… missing student… I must
remind you of the important of… attendance… and while I don’t grade… based on attendance… you can’t
learn if you don’t… come!”
He stopped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 43</a><div class="page-content">moving, and the boy looked up at him, confused, for just a moment, before his eyes
narrowed and he felt the deluge. The teacher put his hand on the back of the boy’s head and looked out
at the class, who watched him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 43</a><div class="page-content">suspiciously. To them, he was perfectly still, but underneath the desk… all
that stress and frustration came up at once, at a boil, into his distressed student’s surprised mouth. His
shaft pulsed as it pumped out the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 43</a><div class="page-content">extra credit assignment that he had so foolishly accepted. The boy’s
eyes were wide at first, but quickly narrowed in sullen anger as he looked up at his teacher, grinning as
he nutted in his mouth. He gagged on it a bit as he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 43</a><div class="page-content">started to swallow, but he quickly suppressed it. The
last thing he wanted was for his classmates to find him now, with jizz in his underwear and a mouthful of
the teacher’s spunk.
He couldn’t believe his teacher ejaculated into his mouth in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 43</a><div class="page-content">front of the whole class… or even at all. He
swallowed it, and his regrets, with his lips still firmly around the teacher’s treacherous cock. Once the
students were caught up in leaving, the teacher allowed himself a moan of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 43</a><div class="page-content">release, looking down at the
little darling between his legs as he reclined lazily in his chair, his arms laying limp at his side. His nubile
little student sucked idly on his popsicle, her lower lip working gently to coax out the rest of his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 43</a><div class="page-content">salty
cream.
His gulps were so loud that he worried the whole class could hear him drinking the teacher’s cocktail.
He moved slowly back and forth to coax out the rest of it, slurping softly, his hands on the teacher’s</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 43</a><div class="page-content">teacher with his mouth, what more could he want?
His teacher, meanwhile, marked down the grade on the grading sheet: B. He looked down at the boy as
the cum foamed out and he swallowed sullenly, even though he'd been told he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 43</a><div class="page-content">didn't have to, and had a
change of heart, and marked down a B- instead. After all, if he was willing to swallow THAT, why not a
B-? Maybe he could work his way up… and if he still really wanted that “A”… well, he’s got to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 43</a><div class="page-content">know his
ABC’s…He withdrew, and the boy spit the rest of his lesson onto the floor. It was to hide the mess he’d made on
his own, but the teacher didn’t need to know that. He smacked his lips idly afterward, one eye lazily</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 43</a><div class="page-content">
half-closed, which gave him the amusing appearance of being drunk, and looked up at the teacher once
more, while the teacher stuffed himself back into his slacks.
“Do I… get an ‘A’?” he said, listlessly.
“’B’ is for blowjob,” he said, wagging</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 43</a><div class="page-content">his finger.
“So then, what’s ‘A’ for?”
Looking up at his teacher’s grin, he knew that he wasn’t going to be returning his sister’s clothes for a
little while longer… if at all.</div></div>
