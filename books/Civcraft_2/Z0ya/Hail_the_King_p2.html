After putting on the items he opened the door. Itaqi was waiting on his bed. “Wow, your so much prettier than I thought you would be. If I saw you on the"</div></div>

At that moment Obsidian was glad that he already put blush on. “Alright” Itaqi said “I want you to clean this house while I’m on my royal duties. Now, give me a kiss goodbye”. He smirked.

When Itaqi got home he was surprised at how clean the house was. He had expected Obsidian to run away when he left; he wasn’t prepared for the possibility that he would stay. He</div></div>

He was still dressed, and Itaqi thought he felt something more than lust, but he pushed it down.  “Sorry about the simple meal, it’s"</div></div>

Itaqi could have sworn he saw his cheeks get even redder for a second. He was confused, did obsidian like being a girl, or was he just doing what Itaqi told him. “How was your day” Obsidian"</div></div>

After both of them were finished Obsidian put both bowls in the sink and gave Itaqi a kiss before heading off to bed. Lying down, Obsidian thought about the day. He"</div></div>

He stopped thinking for a second. The words “girl” and “she” bounced around his head."</div></div>

The next few days were the same; Itaqi went to work, Obsidian cleaned and cooked dinner, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"then they went to sleep. Obsidian thought less and less about escaping, until it was at the back of his mind. More and more he thought about his gender and his identity. He found he enjoyed wearing the clothes and makeup, and continued to do so"</div></div>

He also found he preferred her/she when being referred to, and toyed around with more feminine names. She liked “Obsidia”. She was still confused when it came to her actual identity. She found the thoughts of"</div></div>

On the other hand she had been told she was a boy all her life, and was scared about what other people would think. She wanted to wake up in her compound with none of this ever happening and go"</div></div>

As the days went on seeing her man body in the mirror made her more and more uncomfortable, until she hated seeing herself in the mirror when she looked like a guy. She cried almost every night now, in a mixture of confusion,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 39</a><div class="page-content">fear, and self-hatred.
Itaqi was also confused; every time he saw Obsidia his heart skipped a beat, and he felt like everything was going to be okay. Every day before he got home he was afraid to open the door because he was scared that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"she would be gone. But every day it was the same, he opened the door, the house was clean, and there was food on the table. Her cooking got better too, and she tried new recipes. He didn’t know how he felt about her, but he knew that he"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 39</a><div class="page-content">wanted her in his life.
One day, Itaqi came home and sat at dinner. He looked at Obsidia and smiled. “There’s going to be a party tomorrow at the fountain, would you” he stopped and blushed. He mumbled something “What was that?” Obsidia asked,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"irradiating happiness, she already knew what he was going to say, but wanted to hear him say it. “Would you like to come with me, as my date?” Itaqi said.  “YES! YES I WOULD!” She shouted out, she was happier than she had been in years. That night she"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 39</a><div class="page-content">didn’t cry herself to sleep.
The next day she didn’t make dinner, but she spent her time putting on her makeup expertly and looking for a good dress. Disappointed with her selection, she sat down and thought. She didn’t want to look good</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 39</a><div class="page-content">for the party, she wanted to look spectacular. She decided to buy a new dress. She grabbed a diamond and put her hand on the door knob. Again, she heard the activity in the streets. She took a deep breath, and opened the door.
She walked along</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 39</a><div class="page-content">the street, and to her surprise no one recoiled in horror from her, no one yelled at her and called her a freak, but aside from a few looks of admiration or lust, most ignored her.
With increased confidence, she continued walking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"down the street until she got to the clothing store. Inside there was a large selection of different items, skirts, shoes and dresses. Oh the dressed, there were wedding dresses, large poofy dresses in all colors of the rainbow, sleek"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"curvy dresses, sweater dresses, summer dresses; she was overwhelmed. A store associate quickly approached her. “Hi, can I help you?” she asked. “Well, I’m going to a party tonight, and I don’t exactly know what to wear. It’s my first formal"</div></div>

Obsidia looked around, and was quickly mesmerized by a sparkly red"</div></div>

The store clerk took it from the rack and pointed her to a corner of the store that said “Changing"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"rooms”.  Obsidia went into one of the stalls and stripped down. As she was about to put on the dress the door swung open, and in came the clerk holding a pair of scarlet heels. “Hey I saw these and thought they would go good with your dre-“She stopped"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"when she noticed Obsidia’s penis. “I’m sorry” Obsidia said as she scrambled to grab her clothes. The clerk stepped forward and wrapped her hand around Obsidia. She pulled her close and whispered in her ear “It’s okay, I’ve been looking for"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"someone like you”. She wrapped her free hand around Obsidia’s penis, and gave her a deep kiss. Obsidia closed her eyes and started to kiss back before remembering Itaqi. She pushed the clerk away and said “I’m sorry, I can’t do this. I’m seeing"</div></div>

Obsidia paid for the dress and shoes and went home.
When Itaqi got home he called out to her</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"“Are you ready to go?” She stepped out from the hallway, her long blond hair contrasting with her red everything else. Itaqi was stunned. “Yes I am” she said. She walked out the door. She turned back “coming?” she asked. Itaqi quickly snapped out of"</div></div>
