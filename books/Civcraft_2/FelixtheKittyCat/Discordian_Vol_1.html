I dedicate this concerto to the fair goddess, Eris. I have gone to California and I’ve found out everything. The fair goddess has revealed herself to me and I have seen the light of Discord and have been saved.</div></div>

Recapitulation
“Let this council</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">be called to order.
We convene today for the discussion of several issues, chief among them being Order RmVlZCB0aGUgQ29ycG9yYXRlIGJlYXN0. That’s the one about the redistribution of Ambrosia, right?
First though, we have the business of</div></div>

Rhythm Section
You can know someone by their independent rhythm. Everyone has a rhythm that they follow along at. At every moment they are counting out motions automatically to within the millimeter. As they move they have an</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"internal metronome which they connect to in order to keep organized, like a drum beat. The internal rhythm is the subset of the external rhythm. That means that the external rhythm is a way to synchronize multiple internal rhythms for a unified action."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"This might be rowing, marching, or whatever. Dancing is the purest form of this, because dancing is moving together for the sake of being able to move together.

But, sometimes people get stuck on one beat, like a kind of rhythmic hiccup.

Second Movement
The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis
It’s funny to think, when the party started they didn’t have a single clue what kind of mess was on its way. There wasn’t a soul or pair of soles on Olympus that hadn’t made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">an appearance and yet none of them had any idea.
There was Eros, God of Love, with his golden looks and silver tongue. He posed stoically by the bar; allowing himself to be worshipped by the eyes of passers-by.
Then there was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Pan, a table over. If Eros had a silver tongue then Pan’s was lead. He was clumsily wooing a young nymph over a third round. Luckily for him he had a very large amount of influence and that carried its own attraction.
Aphrodite was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">dancing. She moved like a blossom set adrift by a wind; the incarnation of grace and in the emerald of her eyes a hint of seduction. Her strawberry locks caressed the rosy, supple flesh of her shoulder.
Hera sat just off of the dance floor,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"resplendent in red robes and rubies. An ornate peacock feather fan waved at the cream white of her neck. Her eyes did not wander so much as follow the wanderings of her husband. Of all of the gods it was only Zeus who could deceive her and as such it"</div></div>

At the moment the fair and noble Chairman was speaking to Athena, though it was unclear whether he was flirting. She wouldn’t put it past the cad, but if he was then Athena was having none of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Her sharp face bore its usual fierce expression and her posture was tense. She radiated a pointed aggression, the sinew and muscle of her athletic form rippled when she spoke, always ready for anything.
Dionysus was the one who broke her</div></div>

“Aunt Hera! I’m absolutely overjoyed that you could make it!”
“As am I.”
“Yeah, it’s been a</div></div>

HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAA! Now Ares, jeez what a square. Couldn’t shake a hip if it was in the honor of eviscerating an embattled foe or, uh, whatever, hahahahahaha!”"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">
“Tha-”
“And wow! Have you seen Aphrodite out there? I’ll eat my robe if she hasn’t gotten better since last time... hahahahahahaha! Oh that didn’t come out quite right! Don’t you hate it when stuff like that happens?”
“Yes wel-”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">
“Yeah, her and Hades... who would have thought that hades, I mean, uh, he doesn’t seem like the fun-loving type at all. I mean, we all know he isn’t the fun loving type, but jeez. I mean, where do you learn to move your body like that when you spend</div></div>

Hera glanced over his shoulder as he continued his drunken meandering. Both Zeus and Athena were conspicuously gone. It crossed her mind that perhaps Zeus had arranged for her to be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">cornered by Dionysus while he snuck off. Her face took on a deep apple red hue as she impatiently brushed off her cockeyed captor in search of her disappeared husband.
It was true that of Zeus’ qualities faithfulness was</div></div>

Rather they were discussing an important issue of Cosmological"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Security. Eris, in spite of all of the records of her whereabouts and activities, was still somehow managing to work her influence on the cosmos.
Athena (as official Intelligence Minister) had been doing her best to counter her, but could not find</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">a single moment in which Eris would have been able to set the events into motion. She was entirely baffled.
Zeus and she had stepped away for a moment to review what information they had.
Hera did not find them as she had hoped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 48</a><div class="page-content">to. On the way to the door she found something rather beautiful on a table. It was a golden apple.
There was no tag, card, or any other identifying mark. Only a single phrase was etched gracefully into the side:
“KALLISTE”[5]</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Holy Cow or Wholly Chao?

There was a young Discordian Pope, who was troubled with questions of the faith. He was so troubled by his questions that he consulted his pineal gland for guidance. The Goddess Eris manifested</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 48</a><div class="page-content">herself before him in the form of a large and magnificent bovine animal and spoke unto him.
"There is a question that troubles you?"
"Yes"
"What is the question?"
"I know that the Sacred Chao is the symbolic of the</div></div>

Eris chewed this over for a while. She seemed to be genuinely thinking the problem through. Finally, after quite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 48</a><div class="page-content">some time, she spoke.
