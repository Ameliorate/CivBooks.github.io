A long time ago, I stumbled across these lands, known as civcraft. These lands housed many a city, which gave their people the needs to survive. My first city I stumbled across was Carbon. The people of Carbon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">were nice and friendly. They gave me a home, and the means to provide for myself. The people of Carbon were among the nicest I have ever met. Such people include 
Noir Wolf          Draziw
Kickalll             CarSowrd (pandaaa)
Wanado144    R3NNYB</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">And those are just to name a few.

Anyhow, back to the story. I was quite good friends with Vale (once known as Nexus) as I often made trades for xp items, and they often spoke with Carbon. In particular, snorriandgotrek would often come into the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">mumble to speak to us. One afternoon I was in Fellowship, delivering some goods, when snorriandgotrek invited me to live in Vale. This was during the time when NoirWolf and Draziw were leaving, and were taking the whole town with them. I knew that Carbon</div></div>

It was too good an offer to refuse. I took it. I packed my stuff, and started working on a house. Now, Nexus(Vale) might of been known for collaborating, but they are some of the nicest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">people on the server, and I believe they are also the closest on the server. Vale = family
Yes they bickered, but doesn't mean they didn't treat each other as family.

Once I got settled into Vale, it is the most fun I have ever had on this server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Not to mention the means for gaining wealth, we did a lot of fun activities, and the mumble is often thriving. For example, jezza's photoshops are a work of art. 

I once saw some people fighting on civ pvp, and I thought that looked pretty neat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">So, I started training. First against civ people, then moving on to Kohi people. I was getting better every day, and now, I am probably one of the best fighters on civ, a very small percentage of people on civ can beat me. Never have I thought of using</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">these skills for bad. Now, I would name names of people in Vale who deserve proper mentions.</div></div>
