<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 21</a><div class="page-content">February 2014 saw the beginning of a new era for the city of New Danzilona. The city was instituting a new form of government that was vastly different from the former Minarchist state it had once been associated with. Monthly elections were being</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">instituted, and the positions of City Manager, Infrastructure Representative and Foreign Representative had been created. Before these positions could come fully into their own, however, issues arose with an agreement struck before the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">new government had been elected. Gant2000, founder of Danzilona and New Danzilona, had signed off on the Treaty of Monte Carlo, which sold the island currently known as Melonwood to Cheshirelulcat and the Republic of Monaco for a sum of 150 diamonds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Issues immediately arose over the sale of the land, as many in NDZ argued that Gant had no right to sell the land, and that the borders were too generous to the Monaco intruders. But the deal was done and the signature on the treaty. Some further</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">negotiations continued regarding borders, but the City State of Monaco had bought the land, and so they started constructing their town.

The city of Monaco was a beauty to look at in it's heyday. Brick and Clay buildings, large roads with gardens</div></div>

And it thrived. Newfriends and Oldfriends alike flocked to the city and set up shop, enjoying their newfound freedom under His Sereness, the Doge Cheshire. Several residents</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">of NDZ moved out to Monaco as well. The two nations lived in close proximity, and for a time, were decent neighbours to one another.

However, things started to turn south, and quickly. The government of Monaco started construction</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 21</a><div class="page-content">on a wall to encompass their borders. It had been built initally out of playfulness, and some mock-tension began to occur. It was comparable to the Berlin Wall and it's divisions for a time, but all tension arose in jest, without much actual harsh tones.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The situtation escalated when the Doge Cheshire and Thymos were found to have broken into the basements of NDZ citizen lone22wolf and into structures of fellow U3P city Pella. Bounties were placed and acts were issued, culminating with the banning of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Cheshire and Thymos from NDZ territory until they had paid their reparations. Thus began the war. Cheshire and a few Monacans stormed into the center of NDZ to demand a chance to pay their reps to those who demanded them. The drama flooded into the</div></div>

The fight was quick and ended in a non-resolved draw, the damage already done. Over the next few days,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Monaco citizens such as Thymos, Makanla, and Cheshire entered into NDZ near daily and pearled those they came across, leaving the town desolate and deserted. It seemed as though the war was going to end in favor of Monaco, but suddenly, the tide shifted.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Thymos, who had been the most active of the Monaco fighters, accidentially died due to drowning and lost his PvP gear. Cheshire was pearled near The Commonwealth due to the bounty placed on him. The war was over as quickly as it had begun. It's fighters</div></div>

The town of Monaco had suffered much during the war. The non-combatants had been harassed and left out to dry to no end, for their stake didn't lie in fighting. Many stopped playing</div></div>

What had seemed like a paradise that was on the upturn had dissolved into ash, a dream left unfulfilled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 21</a><div class="page-content">The Monaco War had a profound effect on the town of New Danzilona. It had shown how unprepared the town was for combat or war, and how easily they could be attacked by those who had ill will towards them. People like TheTrackball and JPEGz came together</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 21</a><div class="page-content">later to create a Security Force capable of protecting the town. Additionally, the incident change Danzilonan views on Foreign relations. Many began to be more cautious and question what other's motives were. The people of NDZ did not want to be so easily</div></div>

By the time March 2014 rolled around, the city of Monaco was a ghost of what it once was. Th residents gone, the houses abandoned, the land was slowly reclaimed for New Danzilona and turned into a colony to grow</div></div>
