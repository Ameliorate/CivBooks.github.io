<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content">My eyes opened.

It was a bright morning; the sun was still yet rising in the sky. Strange, but all was quiet. 

In other worlds, noises would assault me; animals, speaking their strange tongues and odd noises; monsters,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">announcing their presence with strange noises you would be wise to acknowledge.

I shivered; the morning sun was not yet hot, and I had nothing on my person but a book. 

Curious, I opened it; who, I wondered, is this "dydomite" fellow?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">It instructed me in the ways of this world; attentive, I carefully read each line and followed each reference until I had exhausted its helps.

My stomach rumbled.

Food; oh, dear. Nervous that my first day might be met with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">starvation, I looked around. Seeing no-one and hearing no-thing, I began to wander about the strange place I had found myself.

Within moments, I found a field; its waving stalks of grain like a pleasant sound to my hungry belly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">I was unsure, however, if the field was public or privately owned. Nervously, I spoke aloud. 

"I found a field... and I fear I might starve. Is it safe to pick from here?"

As if by magic, a voice replied from nowhere:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"I don't know where you are; but if you replant, it should be okay!"

I thanked this kind soul, and while we continued to converse I carefully picked a handful of crops -- enough for a half dozen loaves of bread -- and replanted the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">wheat, in the hopes the owner would not be angered.

After discussing further with the friendly voices from afar, I discovered that I was within walking distance of a place called Mount Augusta.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Mount Augusta. What a name. I sensed portent in that name, but to what end I could not tell.

Munching on my bread contentedly, I put away my book and began walking in the direction the helpful voice had given me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Along the way I found some signs on a house; I had entered this world in "grumptown".

Many questions emerged from this discovery; what, pray tell, was a grump? And where were they all?

The place looked abandoned. Holes in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">windows and missing doors dotted the homes; clear signs of weather and wear and perhaps less savory machinations. I tightened my grip on the wheat; perhaps I was simply lucky that the voice speaking from afar was so kind? Or perhaps this was a ruse.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Well, so be it. If I died, I died; I had nothing of value to lose, so the loss would be the aggressor's. 

As I walked, night began to fall. Accustomed to such worlds, I nervously looked around for signs of more ... aggressive monsters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Yet, although a few appeared at a distance, they were so few in number as to be no threat. 

Well, they would be a threat to me. I had no weapon, no armor. Determined, though, I trugged on. I was nearing the area the kindly voices</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">described, and before long found myself in a grand, sprawling beauty -- Mount Augusta, at last.</div></div>
