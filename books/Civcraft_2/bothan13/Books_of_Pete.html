<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 49</a><div class="page-content">THE BOOK OF JOHNSON
-------------------On a day nearing the end of the time of great peace, Pete looked upon Civcraft and everything about it was finally perfect. This made Pete bored so he came up with an idea. He decided to go get freaky with a chick</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">named Helga Smearboil. Things got sweaty real fast, Helga was wrecked.

After Pete got his game on he abandoned Helga and returned to the Castle in the Sky. Shortly after, Helga has a child. She named him Johnson. Johnson, being the son of Pete,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 49</a><div class="page-content">was half-god, although Johnson had not known of the good word of Pete, he didn't know what to do with this massive amount of power so he decided it would be best if he wreaked havoc on everything. 

For hundreds of years Johnson</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"roamed the Earth destroying civilizations, burning people, and eating melons. Although Johnson, like anyone, had shit to do and no time to do it when he was busy destroying everything, so he gathered up a bunch of people and created a slave camp and had"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 49</a><div class="page-content">them do his bidding.

A few years later Pete looked at Civcraft and saw the evil being spread by Johnson, and said "Shit, this is bad." So Pete decided to go try and stop this evil. He ran down to Civcraft and tried to kill Johnson, but alas Johnson was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"too strong for Pete (after all, Johnson was half-god). So Pete, since he couldn\u0027t kill him, broke his spirit into three pieces. One of them possessed Foofed, a very well know member in the slave camp community, another piece possessed Ke$ha, some fat dude"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">with a terrible voice, and Ron Paul, an old person.

This created the Unholy Trinity. Foofed gained Johnson's power, and after Johnson was gone the slaves had nothing to do, so Foofed turned them all into Infidels and created the evil</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">dictatorship Columbia.
Ke$ha gained Johnson's mind and his thoughts. He went on to make "music" literally formed out of pure evil. Ron Paul gained Johnson's deceit and evilness. He went on to pretending to be a nice guy and running for president. Secretly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">though, he was planning on turning America into a nation of Infidels.

-------------------PT. II: "FOOFED"
-------------------Foofed used to be a normal Civcraftian, but he was enslaved by Johnson, the great evil. He was put in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 49</a><div class="page-content">slave camp with many other people. Johnson made him do terrible thing, like farm melons, although during the time Foofed built up trust with his fellow slaves. He was always making conversation and being as friendly as possible.

"HEY MRGAGETRON,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 49</a><div class="page-content">NICE BUTT!" He would say.

Everyone loved Foofed. It all turned awry when Johnson died. Johnson's most powerful piece of his spirit flew into Foofed. foofed gained ultimate power, no one could stop him. After Johnson died and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 49</a><div class="page-content">slave camp was disband, Foofed decided to use his new power and his high reputation to create a nation, a nation of Columbia.

Columbia existed entirely of infidels and gophers. Although Columbians normally deny the Gopher's existance, they are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">there. They live under Columbia... waiting... waiting... waiting... waiting... Foofed commands these Gophers to do his bidding. 

Why does Foofed do this? Well he still has major psychological issues and can't seem to cope with his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"enslavement. He\u0027s instead decided to enslave other things, and at the time a tribe of gophers lived under Columbia. So Foofed used his great strength to turn them into slaves. He gets some kind of sick thrill from owning slave, he uses them to sweep his "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 49</a><div class="page-content">floor and flush the toilet for him.

Foofed also tries to make Columbia seem like some sort of "Republic". Really though Foofed owns Columbia and is forever dictator, all the otehr positions in the government are Foofed's alts. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">worst part of Foofed, however, he has created his won hell, different from Pete's.
Only Pete may send people to eternal damnation! Foofed overstepped his boundaries when he made his hell and then Pete revealed Foofed's realy identity in the Book of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Johnson.

Foofed must be stopped, we must kill the infidel and free the gophers! Unite Petists: burn Columbia to the ground. Pete orders we send every Columbian citizen to eternal damnation. He spoke to me in a dream and said,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"Eternally Damn every Columbian Citizen!"

So I must do just that, for Pete's sake.

------------------- PT. III: "KE$HA"
-------------------Before Johnson died, KE$HA was just some random guy. He roamed the streets looking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"for cheap bastards to pay him for a handy. KE$HA was the most disgusting man who you could ever see. No one had ever loved KE$HA ever, he was the most hated man in all of existance. He would walk down a sidewalk, wearing only a wife beater and a pair of "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 49</a><div class="page-content">torn boxers. His fat, pimply, stomach would be hanging down from the bottom of his stained torn wifebeater. Even the sidewalk his hideous fat feet were trailing puss all over was more sexually attractive than him.

After Johnson died</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 49</a><div class="page-content">however his evil mind and his evil thoughts entered KE$HAS hideous "body"(if you can even call it that) and he became possessed. He thought of ways he could spread the evil words of Johnston and eventually thought of the ideal solution. He would become a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 49</a><div class="page-content">singer and sing the words of Johnston.

The music he made was entirely evil. If you took all the hatred in the world, compacted it, ate it, and burped it out again it still wouldn't be as bad as KE$HA. Every word in her song spread evil across though of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 49</a><div class="page-content">"each and every person who heard it. Now he is in the process of brianwashing enough people so he can kill Foofed and Ron Paul, take their spirits, and recreate Johnson. Of course Pete gained word of this and published KE$HA\u0027S story"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 49</a><div class="page-content">in The Book of Johnston.

Essentially, Ron Paul is old and unimportant.
