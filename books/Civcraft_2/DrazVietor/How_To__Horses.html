          By Draziw

Breed the best of the best and start your own ranch with this dank-ass guide. SHITS EZPZ.</div></div>

===================Horses, donkeys, and Mules are all sought after for their speed or ability to carry extra shit.  They are faster than minecarts, and can carry 15 extra slots.  You can use Splash Speed II potions to go faster.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">However, horses are limited in their accessability. Horses are annoyingly  2x2 fuckers that can't fit in a minecart's 2x1 shaft. You can take 'em down the CIC with a lead, but watch for corners.  You can ride them down the CiC too, but DONT TRY TO TAKE</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">THEM DOWN THE WATER ELEVATORS! SERIOUSLY, DONT FUCKING DO THIS!

- Types of Horses

Horse
Can be Armored
Varying Jump Height

Donkey
Can be fitted with a Chest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Slower
Low Jump Height

Mule
Can be Fitted with a Chest
Faster than Donkey
Can't Breed

Many want the Mule - The speed of a horse, with the carrying ability of the donkey.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">- Stats
Maximum horse hp is 30 points! Max speed is 13 blocks per second. And max jump height is 5 blocks. If you find a 5-block jumper, congrats! Keep it safe.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">          SETTING UP
             YOUR FARM
===================
A horse farm needs to be large. Horses are relatively big minecraft animals, and you'll be thanking yourself later for building a large pen. DON'T just use fences. They WILL glitch through</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">the fences. Use blocks, fences, double-secure fencegates. You'll have a lot less glitching horses.

To breed, you either need golden apples or golden carrots. Use carrots. Make a small farm in the correct biome, grab some gold. You use 8 nuggets</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">around a single carrot to make a golden carrot. You're going to go through a LOT of these.

Add a sugar cane farm for Sugar. Sugar adds growth % to horses, thought not as much as Haybales. You can grow a wheat farm as well, but it depends on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">space you have. 

Make seperate pens for Donkeys, Mules, and Horses. It will make things easier.  Have another area where you can have a donkey and a horse together to periodically pop out mules.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Saddles & Leads are VERY important. So you're going to need the animal husbandry factory. It's expensive, but worth it. 

Use the normal Factory Setup.

Fur    Craft     Chest
nace  Table     chest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Put in 64 iron blocks, 64 haybales, 64 golden apples, and 16 slime balls. Wack it with a stick. Boom!

Recipes:
8 Saddles for 64 white wool, 64 leather, 16 diamonds using 10 charcoal.
8 Leads for 16 string, 4 slimeballs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Horse armor is very pretty, but most of the time useless. But armorless horses are for fucking plens.
1 Diamond Armor for 64 Diamonds, using 10 Charcoal
1 Iron Armor for 64 iron, using 10 Charcoal
1 Gold Armor for 64 gold ingot, using 10 Charcoal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">            BREEDING
                YOUR HORSES
===================

Grab your golden carrots, kiddo. It's time for your horses to do the diddly-do. Grab your leads to make things easier. 

Step 1: Get horses.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Step 2: Tame the horses by right clicking them to 'break' them. You'll succeed when you get hearts floating everywhere and opening the inventory works.

Step 3: Feed the Fucker. Now he's hot and ready. Feed another, get a baby.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Step 4: Wait 5 Minutes. 

Speeding Up Your Foal Growth:

Sugar (30SEC)
Wheat (1MIN)
Apple (1MIN)
Golden Carrot (1MIN)
Bread (3MIN)
Golden Apple (4MIN)
Hay Bale (3MIN)
A foal takes 20min.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The items on the previous page (minus the hay bale) can also be used to increase taming chances, but it's not worth it unless you are really frustrated, then just pour some sugar on your horse.

Notes:
HORSES CAN ONLY BREED IN DAYLIGHT</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 32</a><div class="page-content">If your horses are failing to breed, check above you. Is there a roof? Yes? Well, fuck. Now you have to wait 5 more minutes.

Breeding mules is easy. 1 Donkey + 1 Horse = Mule. They're always the same color, so enjoy your brown.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 32</a><div class="page-content">              BREEDING 
               THE BEST
===================
You want the stronkest horse? Or a jumper? Fast? 

Test each horse for the desired stat you want. Hearts are obvious, stack blocks for jump height, and worry not about</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 32</a><div class="page-content">speed unless you are really unlucky. On Civcraft, all horses are SUPPOSED to go the same speed... but they may or may not. So check yourself.

Breeding selectively means you take your two horses with the stat you desire and make them breed together.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The resulting foal will be an average of the two parent's stats, and have a color that is based off the parent's colors but is sometimes completely random (in the case of horses only. Donkeys and Mules are all the same color.)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Since normal breeding is based upon averages, the best horses are found in the wild or in eggs.


We'll cover that next, nerd.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">               HORSE EGGS
         A FUCKIN MIRACLE
===================
Horse eggs. What the fuck are they? They are sold in most cities for a few diamonds, and they spawn horses.

They are racist as SHIT though, so they only very rarely spawn Donkeys,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">which you need for mules. So get a shit ton of eggs.

Or you don't have enough? Fuck. Take the horses you do have and breed them together. Make a bunch of the little fuckers, speed them up, and start KILLING THEM.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">DONT KILL THEM WITHOUT A BANE 5 LOOT 3 SWORD.

Don't have one? Fuckin buy one, scrub. Or sell  your goddamn horse.

Yes, loot 3 does increase the chance of an egg to drop.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">- The Miracle 

Horse eggs are a fucking miracle because they RANDOMIZE ALL STATS. That means you can get shitty fuckers who go 7meters a second and have no fuckin hp, or one that jumps 5. Wrap your head around that one, you shithead.</div></div>
