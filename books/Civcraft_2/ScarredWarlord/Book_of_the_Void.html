And the Void was pushed out, deep beneath the earth. And it grew hostile towards Notch and his creations. Notch continued shaping his new world, creating mountains and hills, giving bodys to the</div></div>

Out of the Void he formed netherrack, and created great mountains and overhangs. But the Void grew ever more spiteful and corrupted the Nether. Mild weather turned to dry and harsh. Pigmen were slain, only to</div></div>

Slimes were charred. Water turned to lava. And the Nether became a deadly place. And Notch created once again a great barrier of bedrock to stop the advance of the Void.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">And the Void seeped through the bedrock barrier in the Overworld, turning water near it to lava and creating hostilities between the creatures of the night and day.

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">And Notch set to work on a third realm, the End. And out of the Void Notch began shaping Endstone. But the Void withdrew from the Overworld and Nether, attacking Notch with its full ancient might. Notch withdrew from the End, leaving nothing in it but the</div></div>

Out of itself it shaped Endermen and sent them forth to the Overworld, to slay its creatures and to destroy its blocks. But the Endermen were not able to destroy the gate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">which Notch created, thus leaving the End exposed to attack.
