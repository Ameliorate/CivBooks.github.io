<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">As one can plainly see, Terminus has lots of factories.

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">the Bastion Factory, the NetherFactory, the Advanced Redstone Mechanism Factory, and a few others.

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Section 2: Outposts

Terminus has many outposts which we use to produce resources that cannot be sourced from the main city or the immediate surrounding area. They include farms and production areas. They are restricted to TF1 citizens, but available</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">There are a few other outposts that require a higher access level, are under construction, or are in the early planning stages. They are not included.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Section 3: Politics and Community

Terminus boasts a small but diverse community of individuals who want to help each other reach each other's goals. The city does not currently have an official government, but rather the power of the city</div></div>

The political structure of the city, with its lack of existence thus far, creates a mostly drama-free environment. Trading and international relations is also a part of the community.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Terminus is on good terms with all of its neighbors, which include SPQR Roma, New Senntisten, Volterra, and Orion. The community prides itself on including everyone after they have proven their worth to the group, which can be as simple as staying in town</div></div>

The resources are put towards further infrastructure projects, though this policy might be subject to change. Buildings are also an important part of Terminus. The builds in the city so far are fairly impressive.</div></div>

Terminus is a city for players of all experience levels. We welcome anyone who is willing to work for their worth, who is willing to sacrifice himself for the worth of the whole group of his own will, who is willing to</div></div>
