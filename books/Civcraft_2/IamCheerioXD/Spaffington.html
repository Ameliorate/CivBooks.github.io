Preface

I joined civcraft on the 20th of April 2014 with several other friends (notably Salloogy and R3NNYB) looking to make a town. Over a year later, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">still miss the town that we made. Spaffington at it's prime was surprisingly active, but as they always are, very undeveloped.

Chapter One, the Rise.

Our town was young, and all players were new to CivCraft. We did not understand the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">plugins, often ignoring them. Our knowledge of minecraft was basic, most days were spent mining or building walls round the city, with no idea how to actually protect a city. However, we grew and we grew, at our peak we had about 15 active citizens, most</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">logging on daily and helping us. One worthy of significant mention is 84lemmings who was always eager to help with our farms. Eventually we recruited 2 neo nazis who wanted to establish a facist dictatorship into our friendly small town. Things were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">looking up for Spaffington, little did we know what was about to come.

Chapter Two, the Fall.

When mining early on, I discovered a rail running underneath our town. Unknown to us this was actually the CIC between CW</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">and Carson. Whilst I was mining some diamonds (we were in a diamond vein the whole time and didn't even know) my curiosity got the better of me and I followed it, until I reached a private property then immedietly ran back scared. But, a few days later we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">went back. We followed the rail further this time, and found a little hole. Wanting to get out, one of our friends dug a hole through the wall with the intention to patch it back up. But, we were met with lava. It spilled over the CIC and we had nothing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">to repair the wall with. So, we ran. About a minute later, someone in Prot4 rode past us, and a few minutes after that, we arrived at Carson. At first we were welcomed, and brought food and minecarts, but then they realised one of their own had just died</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">to some lava grief on the CIC. Short story, we were pearled apart from 2 who haven't logged on to this day. We thought we would never get out, the person who griefed the CIC tried making excuses but to no avail. We were stuck. In skype, one of the last</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">non-pearled players swore revenge, and later that day lava bombed Carson. We thought we had won, not knowing how easy it was to clean up. 

A week later, we were released with no claims, nothing was lost on Ariaxis (the person in the cart) and no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 17</a><div class="page-content">reps were to be paid. But, we returned to Spaffington to a blazing mess, unreinforced and made out of wood, half the city was gone with all our diamonds stolen and our (limited) factories destroyed. We are still unsure of who burned down the city. We know</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 17</a><div class="page-content">now that we could have been in Carson's land claims, but we don't think it was them, probably one of our own. 

Chapter Three, New
Beginnings.

R3NNYB, although our IRL friend, never joined our town and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">instead had settled in Carbon. Eventually with Wanado144 he moved to Mt Augusta, Salloogy and I followed.

Since then, I have lived in Mt Augusta almost permanently for a year. I've experienced hockey games, pearlings, New_Yardbird's turn.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Those core players of Wanado144, Delphsta, Ladezkik, New_Yardbird, R3NNYB and zaphod100 are the main reason Mt Augusta is alive today and the powerhouse it is. Although the 7 of us were going to leave at one point, I am glad the exodus failed. Since then,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 17</a><div class="page-content">key players have taken the reins of MtA and ProgrammerDan has cemented our place as a town. Spaffington remains burnt, and although there was a brief revival in ShadedSpaff, a micronation on top of ShadedJon's house/bunker, it will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 17</a><div class="page-content">stay that way.
