<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 23</a><div class="page-content">When the universe began, the Gods and Goddesses had just created the world.

They then saw that the creatures of the world where too cold, so they created the sun. But then they where dieing of thirst, so they created water.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The creatures also needed challenge, so they created night time where it was dark.

But Morsius, the God of Death, thought this was too little. Against the other God's wills, and created monsters that are pulled into the world from his soul at night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">For this, the other Gods cast him into a new realm they created, that we call the Nether. The Nether, also referable to as Hell, is a terrible place full of lava and red rock.

There are evil rituals that can be performed to make portals to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 23</a><div class="page-content">this realm. But when they cast him there, he made a dragon, that made energy that destroyed anything it touched. They cast this dragon into a small pearl, but do to the energy called Ender Energy, they duplicated. They where spread around the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content"> Then after the deal with the God of Death, Termusio, the God of Musis and Language, gave his gifts to the creatures of the world.</div></div>

So the Gods split into factions. The factions battled and battled until most gods where dead. Only 6 remained.
They are the following:</div></div>

So the creatures took control.

The ones that got the Gifts of Language and Music where Humans.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">They started forming civilisations and making clans.   This era would be known as Civcraft I. 
The Humans could not be like the now vegetable like gods, as the Humans where now violent and made terrible wars.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 23</a><div class="page-content">So the humans started making books, art, and magnificent structures.

The other creatures did not fail though, they dominated the jungles and mountains.

But the Humans where much more important.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 23</a><div class="page-content">They started sailing oceans, and making watercrafts.

They eventually became even more powerful than the Gods. So they made war on the Gods, trying to destroy them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">They went up to the sky realm of Hyroriusium, and slayed the Gods.

But when they took the energies, they could not handle it. So they found portals in Hyroriusium that when the energy cast into them and mixed with the Ender Energy, it sent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 23</a><div class="page-content">duplicates of the portals around the world to the mysterious realm of the End. Humans started hunting for them, but finding the pearls made in the beginning. They used them as prisons, sending the people to the End in Era I and Era II.</div></div>

In other scripts I read things about repeating history.

This may mean that Era II could be coming to a close.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 23</a><div class="page-content"> The world could end.

Civilisations would fall, fire flailing from the sky destroying everything.

It will kill us all, but it also may open a new Era. It could have the Gods reborn with the energy released from the End.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 23</a><div class="page-content">They could start a New Beginning, a Third Era.


   The Third Era is here, the sky is closing, we must try and survive the Apocolypse. Darsk is based on peace, and an Apocolypse defies that.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 23</a><div class="page-content">So we, declare that we shall not face anything like this. We will hide in the End,Hell, and anywhere inbetween. We will not die out. For we are all Humans. We must band together for the Apocolypse these scripts predict.

We must survive.</div></div>
