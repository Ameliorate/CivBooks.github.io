 A Brief Philosophical

  Introduction to the

<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 42</a><div class="page-content">technologies and cultures as best suits any given situation.

It's about the anarchist urban hunter-gatherer squatting the ruins of the city living side-by-side with the micro-hydro engineeer who has rigged the water running</div></div>

It's about the permaculturalist who collects camera lenses to build solar cookers. It's about the living food-forests that we'll turn our towns into.

It's about never laboring again (In this case, we are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 42</a><div class="page-content">defining labor as "unnecessary, un-enjoyable work"). Frankly, it's about destroying civilization and saving the world and living a life of adventure and fulfillment.

We don't need a hell of a lot of political theory. Here's a stab</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 42</a><div class="page-content">at it regardless.

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Post-civilized thought is based on three simple premises:
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
1. This civilization is, from its foundation, unsustainable. It probably cannot be salvaged, and, what's more, it would be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 42</a><div class="page-content">undesirable to do so.

2. It is neither possible, nor desirable, to return to a pre-civilized state of being.

3. It is therefore desirable to imagine and enact a post-civilized culture.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Premise 1: We Hate Civilization</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

When we're discussing civilization, we're discussing the entirety of the modern world's organizational structures and approaches to culture. We're talking about the legal and societal codes that dictate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"proper" behavior. We're talking about the centralizing and expanding urges of political empire. (If you're the type that likes definitions, we've got a specific one for you in the back.)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Premise 2: We're Not Primitivists</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

We're not primitivists: primitivists reject technology. We reject the inappropriate use of technology. Primitivists reject agriculture: we're not afraid of <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>horticulture</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>, but we reject <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>monoculture</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> (and</div></div>

Primitivists have done a good job of exploring the problems of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">civilization, and for this we commend them. But on the whole, their critique is un-nuanced.

What's more, the societal structure they envision, tribalism, can be quite socially conservative: what many tribes lacked in codified law, they made up for in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">rigid "customs," and one generation is born into the near-exact way of life as their predecessors.

We cannot, en masse, return to a pre-civilized way of life. And honestly, many of us don't want to. We refuse to blanketly reject everything</div></div>

It's like recycling, but for everything! Bottles and houses and ideas alike! We are for the present, the thrashing endgame of civilization, as one of the most invigorating and worthwhile times to be alive. We cannot help</div></div>

And, you know what? We're not afraid of a little specialization. Skills like food growing and distribution are shared, but it's a <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>good</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> thing that</div></div>

There are enough <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>things</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> already made to enable a non-growth-based economy to last for a pretty long time. There are plenty of bike frames and tin roofs</div></div>

<span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>Civilization</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

My dictionary defines <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>civilization</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> as "the stage of human social development and organization that is considered most advanced." Clearly, this is bullshit. Derrick Jansen,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">anti-civilization theorist, has proposed a more useful definition of civilization: "a culture -- that is, a complex of stories, institutions, and artifacts -- that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities (civilization, see <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>civil</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>: from §</div></div>

Another working definition can be derived from Wikipedia: "a society defined as a complex society characterized by the practice of agriculture and settlement in cities ...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Compared with less complex structures, members of a civilization are organized into a diverse division of labor and an intricate social hierarchy."</div></div>

Derrick Jensen has defined <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>city</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> as: "people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life." My dictionary says: "a large town". Great.</div></div>

Either way sounds pretty crap to me.</div></div>

From Wikipedia: "The economic concept of voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit." It has also been described by Kropotkin as being an alternate force in the evolution of species</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">than that of competition.
