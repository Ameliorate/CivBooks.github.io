  In the northern reaches of the Rhine, among the many Germanic tribes lived the Franks, great ancestors of Charlemage and and future founders of one of the greatest empires in the world. And among the</div></div>

  A great dragon, angered by the attempts of obsessive and overconfident adventurers trying to loot his lair, laid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">waste upon much of Clovis' domain. Conpany after company of great soldiers and men, sent by the generous ruler were slaughtered mercilessly. Clovis' pleads were left unanswered; the rulers of nearby lands all cowered in fear of that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">formidable creature. Legends of the dragon and the path of destruction it left were told far and wide. So much so that it was able to reach the ears of the fierce warrior Ascaric.
  Born with the noblest of blood and ferocious spirit, Ascaric journeyed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">from his far off land up the Rhine to aid Clovis in his plight. As his expedition was nearing its end the telltale signs of the brutal beast were visible. The scorched countryside still smoldered from its burning breath. Nontheless, the bold warrior</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">finally reached Clovis' castle, perched upon a promontory overlooking the Rhine, its stone walls inpenetrable to the dragon's fiery assault.
  Ascaric, arrived at the keep was greeted with great skepticism at first, but Clovis trusted the foreign fighter,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">promising hum great riches and glory if he were able to best the great beast. Armed with the knoledge of the dragon's lair, and the weapons and armor bestowed to him and bledded by his ancestors he set forth to go where scores of me met their untimely</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">fate.
  In short time he arrived at the den where both countless remains and riches resided. Even at the entrance of that acernous crypt lay the dusty bones of the deceased. Slowly Ascaric made his way into the great chamber where the dragon laid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">resting. Piles of gold, silver and precious gems lined the floor of the ancient vault. Goblets, tapestries and crowns from various kings and kingdoms served as the bedding for that cruel creature. As Ascaric stepped forth the dragon awoke, startled by the</div></div>
