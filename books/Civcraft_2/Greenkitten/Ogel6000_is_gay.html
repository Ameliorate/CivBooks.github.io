Suitable for all ages.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">
   Once upon a time, there was a huge homosexual gay fuck called Ogel6000. He was the gayest gaybo in the gayaverse. Everyone knew he was gay but did not what to acknowledge it due to the fact that they didn't want to listen to his gay whining.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">  "Waaahh, waah." Cried Ogel6000, "Why won't anyone accept the fact that I am a big gay faggot?" He moped and moaned his way around the server. Not even the humongous faggots over at the LSIF would give him an ear. Dejected and lonely he conjured a plan.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">  "I'll show them!" Grumbled Ogel6000 to himself, "I'll build the biggest, gayest rock on the server and I'll create a completely homosexual flag for it too!"

And so Sariliana was born.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">So months of work later there became the largest gayest rock on the server, floating gayly over the ocean deep in the +,- far away from the rest of the server.

"Now they will come, now they will know how much of a poof I really am!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Weeks past.
         No one came.

Months past.
         No one came.


  "Why don't people visit me and my big gay rock!?" He complained on the subreddit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">

  "Because you're
     a fag." 

 A booming response came from the rest of the community.


    "We'll then I'm
       quitting!" 
          He responded</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">
"But before I go..."

     The subreddit let            out one last
          synced sigh.

"I'm going to give all my faggot gay shit to the person who validates my time on the server by writing a shitty novel."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">All the horrid writers from the server got hard, their years of writing shit stories on fanfiction.net had paid off! They could finally put their skills towards gaining some e-lego valuables!

Dicks hard and pens out these fuckwits got writing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">With an inflated ego and a delited squeal Ogel6000 was finally getting the recognition he thought he so deserved. His could not contain himself, "I can't wait for someone to write some smut about me!" Reaching for his swollen cock.

"MMMmmnnnn...."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">

    "YES!"
   


         "Oh yeah..."



  "Write more."</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">His ego could not be contained. Seed spilling everywhere, and basking in the glow of his computer screen. Ogel6000 has finally found some self worth. 
Several smutty books written, less than 100 half brained goodbye posts and his time here came to an end.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">




   See ya Ogel6000.



      We might miss you.
