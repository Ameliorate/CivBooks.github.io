<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> Dedicated to all my loving friends and family and also my dog.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Chapter 1: Dog
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>My dog barks.

This does not mean my dog is a bad dog. My dog is not unlike other dogs. Other dogs bark too. I have heard them. They are barking all the time. Usually when I walk down the street I often hear a dog barking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">So when my dog barks it is of no concern. It is what dogs do, they bark. Natural, normal, nothing out of the place. The dog is as it should be. My dog is not broken, just a normal barking dog.

I can't complain about that, it is in a dog's nature to bark.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Chapter 2: Dog2
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Sometimes I bark back at my dog. My dog barks at me and I reply back with a "Woof!" 
My dog is a big dog so it makes a big dog bark, and I am a big boy so I make a big dog bark too.
Little dogs go "Yip yip!" My dog doesn't.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">When my dog does a big dog bark and I reply with a big dog bark my dog sometimes gets confused. My dog tilts its head to the side as though it is questioning me. 
I didn't ask a question though, I just said "Woof!" A reply. Nothing more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I don't think dogs have a language, some people do but I don't. I understand that dogs are dogs and that they don't understand people all that well.

So I just make a dog sound in reply to my dog because it really doesn't matter.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Chapter 3: Calls
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Sometimes when I am on the phone my dog likes to bark. When people are unfamiliar with me they will ask "Is that a dog in the background?" I will respond and inform them that, Yes, it is a dog in the background. It is my dog barking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I have a dog. My parents are dog people and I was raised a dog person. A dog person is a person that likes dogs, not a dog-person hybrid. I have met people that get confused. They like to dress up in dog costumes and go to events together.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">I have seen pictures.

I don't like it.

Sometimes I talk to these people in my calls. They are strange but they don't mind my dog in the background. They are used to it now.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>Final chapter: Dog3 </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>My dog is a nice dog. I like my dog. It is normal for a dog to bark and I don't think I would like a dog that doesn't bark. Barking dogs are fun. When you poke them, they bark. When you pull their fur, they bark. 
My dog is fun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">

I do like my dog. Even if it barks.


    The end.</div></div>
