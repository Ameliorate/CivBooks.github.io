This book is being written in an attempt to document the history of the town of Boston. I will make note of all important events to happen within the town, but I am only one man. Some events will be missed and I regret that I will not be able</div></div>

This is not Boston's first day of existance. Boston had existence last year as an attempted town built by my friends and I. As time went, we lost interest and gave up almost entirely. However, olaf_underhaven</div></div>

I rejoined him and now the two of us are managing this town. We appointed olaf_underhaven as President and myself as Secretary of State for the first government of the revived Boston.</div></div>

Currently, we have large wheat farms for XP farming, a sustainable melon farm, 4 captured cows, a stone</div></div>

That way, only a trusted group of players know of this town's whereabouts and our location remains secret. Hopefully, we can succeed at this.</div></div>

Today I have begun the call for allies. On facebook I called for men to join us and so far BownDownToRah has become part of out city again. A former member, he is now back to help rebuild this city into something powerful.</div></div>

As of the moment, I am beginning to layout Parliamentary procedures. With our small numbers, an electoral vote is unrealistic. Therefore, elections will be entirely popular vote for now. The President shall be elected and so too will two minor</div></div>

Greenkitten has found this book in the ruins of what looks like what was once was a home.
