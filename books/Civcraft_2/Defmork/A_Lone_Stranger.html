Relevant is the story
I have to tell, what I accomplished, who I met, and not a silly name my dumber Me named the account he bought 2 years ago.

First time I heard about civrcaft, was in /r/minecraft. Someone posted about the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">concept of pearling in civcraft, and I thought "Ah, cool" and forgot it. Some months later, in the summer holidays, I was bored, but voll of ideas. 
I wanted to play minecraft again, but without friends, who where on vacation, it would've been pretty</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">boring soon.
So I thought about joining a public server, and after some research, I found the pearling-post on Reddit again, and looked for the server-IP on the /r/civcraft sub.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">When I first logged in, I found myself in fucking nowhere. Only me, the rule book, and desert. After a long walk I climbed on top of an ice mountain, and wrote my first comment on this server ever:

"Test."

which was soon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">answered by someone, whose name I forgot:

"No testing, only dreams"

Impressed by his wise words, I fucking starved due to a lack of food.

When I spawned again, it was only me,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">an ocean, and no book. I drowned myself.

The third time I spawned near a city. I wandered happily to the city whose name was "Osaka", as a sign told me. It was a pretty city, but I saw none who lived there. After a bit chatting, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">learned that this city was abandoned. But a nice guy, who is a co-owner of a ware transportation service, told me the way to the nearest, inhabitated city, Fort Ironside. i equiped myself with stone tools and food in a hut, which offers ressources</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">for the n00bs. I even got an iron armor, of which I still wear 75% of by another nice guy. The first nice guy showed me the place where he lived, in a nice small house in Kokopolis, near Ironside, and a nearby plot which I could build my house on.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I went offline, because I had been online for solid 3 hours at this moment, and I was unpleasently surprised when I saw my plot taken by another guy, who had been online after me. Unfortunately, I didn't clame the plot for me, with a sign or whatever, so</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">I wondered, whether I could obtain a plot, which two well-known dudes from the town offered. I put a sign on there, which said, that the plots had gained my interest, but there came no answer, not the first day, not the second, not the third.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">A bit later, as I wandered through the Commonwealth, homeless, and starving, a rich, popular business man witnessed my misery, and offered me a generous, big part of his land, which I could build a house on. Shocked by his kindness, and generousity I went</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">into the nature, and collected ressources, which I build my first house on. 

While I write these sentences, the house becomes prettier, more and more, and to this time I saw, and witnessed many events and things and people, which I couldn't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">write down, because, yeah, fuck typing.
I helped someone with building a borough, I bought rare items from a minecraft-millionaire, I saw players go on and off, I saw many parties gaining popular interest, and being seen in a bad light of the majority, I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">saw people destroying buildings, killing people and raiding banks, and I saw people building wonderful houses and monuments, introducing new players and pearling said evil-doers. 

At this time, there are the elections, where the future leader of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">the Commonwealth's borughs are being elected. The result won't matter in the end, I will continue playing Civcraft, and become as rich as the richest, and most popular players. 

I'll build a borough, in the air. There will live only the richest, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">best looking people of Civcraft, while outsiders will be ignored and killed, if the try to reach the borugh. I will hire a mercenary called Kruger, who will hunt said wannabe-immigrants, and I will change my name to Miss Delacourt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Also, I'll learn how to speak french.

Nah, just joking, that was a part of the plot "Elysium", by Neill Blomberg, but a new borough by me would be nice, though.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 19</a><div class="page-content">My story doesn't have an end, until this server does.

The Server is Civcraft, an individual minecraft experience.</div></div>
