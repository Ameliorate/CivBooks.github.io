Clone was often said to be a powerful indivual, often when spoken of it is said the earth rumbles. Now a powerful foe like this has needs and wants that not anyone can meet. Well one day a single man came on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 31</a><div class="page-content">the server, his name was Papa_pound. It was said when they met they instantly fell in love. By all accounts, Papa made the first move, slowly and sexually licking his feet, all the pressure of walking in such big shoes leaves a man wanting some relief.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 31</a><div class="page-content">He began rubbing his inner thy slowly at first, but picking up speed and kissing him all the way to the middle, till he got to his dick. When he got to his penis he was fully erect and this turned papa_pound on soo much he began to lick vigorously almost</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 31</a><div class="page-content">as if he were a kid in a candy shop where he can get anything he wanted. Up and down his tounge wraped around his dick, clone thought this would be warmer but he couldn't complain, all that dry jerking had made this smooth wet feel all the better.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Papa_pound knew clone touched himself on a daily basis because he himself lived much the same. Today was a new day though, he had finally met the one. The simple thought of this made papa crazy and took clones dick and spit on it, clone couldn't last</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">much longer but papa said "Unleash your load onto me clone, it will go it better tighter places if you do <3" A stream of his warm love emptied onto papa's face in gushes, but clone didn't stop there he finished papa off with a golden shower, warm golden</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">water all on his face. Papa smiled at this as he had a little jizz of his own on his tip, he had only heared of this type of happines but he was living it! All the books described it but this was diffrent.
He felt it, in his heart and in his mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2: Screen is now in this book, help me, she is holding me captive!

Screen walked onto the sleeping papa_pound and clone, they looked like 2 sleeping beauties. She was alone in life and they looked so happy, she just had to join them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">She slowly slipped in and  squeezed clone like one of her wifu body sized pillows. he opened his mouth as to ask why, but she put her slender fingers on his lips to hush him. She slowly reached down his pants. As she rubbed his dick in an ever smooth</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 31</a><div class="page-content">motion papa pound awoke to the sunlight in his eyes, he turned to see a strange visitor in his bed. She and clone together, her giving him a handjob. It angered him, he thought of their last night as tears pooled in his eyes, he ran, ran far away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Clone wanted to chase but screen pinned him down. She wasn't letting him get away, not after being rejected by paradox095. (He is amazing if I do say) She forced herself on him, kissing him forcfuly to the point where clone pucked his lips in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">She wasn't having so she began to to do something she never thought she do, she would do anything to not be rejected again. She knew his mind wouldn't allow her in but his body would. So she raised her skirt over his dick and lowered herself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">She rode him like a bull rider rides a bull. He bucked under it all but his body gave in instantly. She wasn't going to be rejected again so she wasn't. It may have been mins of plesure for her but it was hours of pain for him, he was doing this but not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">with the one he loved, it felt wet in and warm, oh so warm inside of her and thats when it happened.

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">before he left. He entered and right as he was about to flip the switch a random person tackled him. Punching and kicking him with a force so strong it knocked his wind out. As he was on the ground coughing up a little blood he heared his towns security</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 31</a><div class="page-content">foces comming, they picked up on the snitch movment from the random man. He fled but not befor saying "That one is for your work with Blood crew!"</div></div>

Clone was rushed to the hospital, coughing blood. It reminded him in some sick ways of how he helped blood crew harass civcraft. In the end of it he still claims to be a just man but in his heart, he knew he was not.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 31</a><div class="page-content">It was nearing midnight when there was a knock on clone's door.

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 31</a><div class="page-content">he responded with a light glow in his eye "I forgive you clone!" and pounced at clone with a passion in his heart.

<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I'll be gentel." and entered into clones anus slowly, it felt tight, tigher than anything he ever felt befor, almost to tight to enter but he gave it a gooe nough shove to get in there.
