It all started one mid day after noon, I had just died from a mighty battle and had respawned by Mount Augusta and New Deroit. Now I heared there was horney women here but I didn't expect what what to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 21</a><div class="page-content">come. The first step I took I was surrounded by many beautiful women all wanting me for one reason, sex. Before I cou;d even talk they tackled me down and started sucking my dick, one after another. Just non stop action. I had to beat em off</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 21</a><div class="page-content">litteraly and figurativly to get away safley. Just when I thought I got away I was confronted by the mean and scary screen name!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 21</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2: Screen is always evil

When I saw her, she had bright blue hair and mis matching eyes, kinda off if you ask me. She said "So you are the mighty Paradox that my women have heared so much about, we heared tales of your battles</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 21</a><div class="page-content">all the way here, they say you single handedly took on play pen 20 to 1 only to die to accidently falling into lava!"

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 21</a><div class="page-content">wait I cant! My heart only beats for one woman and it's not you!" She seemed depressed and said to me in a low rattling voice "If I can't have you, no one can!" She lept at me with an anger and rage of having your heart riped out and living with it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 21</a><div class="page-content">I lept from the room and ran to Mount Augusta as fast as I can, as I looked back I saw all the horney women I left in New Detroit at the gate, I just wondered how I made it out with the ability to make children. As I ran I heared ScreenName yell one last</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 21</a><div class="page-content">thing "You shall be mine Paradox095!"
When I heared that I saw the tall and blinding buildings of Mount Augusta, the largest city in the world!</div></div>

I began to explor the city when I came across two well known ladies called meuiner_ and bearica. They didn't attack me on sight so that was a good sign</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 21</a><div class="page-content">They told me they had no interest in me so I was like "ok cool sweet, please direct me to the nearest hotel" They pointed me to the right direction. Upon going there I heared some yelling in a near by allyway, it was a man and woman try fighting! Being a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 21</a><div class="page-content">gentelman I am, I stood in and asked what was wrong, the woman said the man was trying to pay for sex but she wasn't having it. I looked the man stright in the eyes and said "Thats now how you get all the ladies!" I wiped out my dick and said "M'lady" in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 21</a><div class="page-content">the best tone I could manage. She went nuts and began sucking the life out of me, no teeth all tounge, just the way I like it. She was insane about it, she even managed to mumble "Put it in my ass next" Thats when I knew to stop, breaking a lady's heart</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 21</a><div class="page-content">is bad news. The man Looked me in the eyes and said in the meanest voice possible "You'll regret this, otherwise my name isn't programmerdan!"

her</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 21</a><div class="page-content">horney friends and they all tried to have sex with me but I managed to get away to the motel.</div></div>
