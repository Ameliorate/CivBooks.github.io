<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">attack and was caught off guard however within 1 minute jj was down to a half heart and twing had full hearts

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">just as twing was about to bring down his wooden shovel for the final blow he heard a scream irl

he went outside and helped the injury baby rabbit to escape from the clutches of the evil chavs and was a true hero. later that evening</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">the queen phoned him and announced he was now heir to the throne 
twing logged back on roughly 10 minutes later and discovered jj had pearled him

but twing did not fear. he had an alt.

he logged in as his other acc and went</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">to aeon where jj was hiding in an dro 200 layer y=0 vault

his whistled and spammed ppsummon and leagues of hcf members came to his assistance. he rode above them like they were one fluid multi-person horse
they were back in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">aeon in minutes

"to work, men!" he shouted. the 500 men who also now included every person who he had passed, who had felt convulsed to join twing's parade due to the glowing glorious aura coming off of his body</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">within days, the 200 blocks DRO obsidian pyramid was down to just 1 layer and they smashed it open

inside was jj, holding a sword to twing's dog and the pearl to twing's mainacc

"no" said twing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">jj brought the sword down on the dog but nothing had happened

jj looked around in horror

suddenly from behind a name flickered. who was it?

it was another of twiong's alts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">he had been feeding the dog bones on another monitor to feed it up so it didn't die

"hahahah" said twing as he brought down his god wooden sword on jj

"gg" was all jj could muster as he fell into</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">the abyss.

"wow" said ollie walking up to jj and twing. it had taken him 17 days to reach them again. " maybe having an alt isn't the worst idea ever. what your alt did there was phenomenal"

"what alt?" asked twing. he too was confused</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content">as to what had happened that fateful day in april. "i only have 2 accs and one was pearled, yet somehow my dog was saved"

ollie looked at twing for a long time and twing looked back, and in that moment, twing realised just what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content">had actually happened.

ollie winked at twing then walked off into the distance, off to go grief some random guys house. twing watched him through the green tinted windows of the sh3t shack and through the tear tinted veils of water on his eyes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 20</a><div class="page-content">acknowledgements:
