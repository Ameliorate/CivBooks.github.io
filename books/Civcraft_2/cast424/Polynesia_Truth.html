That is what I use to think until I moved to check out the country of Polynesia. This was the country that showed me fixed mindsets are one of the worst things you could have. This is a book about my"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">"opinions on the term National Socialism. From the people ive talked to in the -,- they say polynesia is evil or corrupt. I see it as a sleeping giant that people in the world should talk to before creating ignorant rumors. Here is what I learned in Pol."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content"> 1. Hitler isnt the only National Socialist -

    The average person thinks Hitler was a nazi and that makes all nazis evil. WRONG! Yes he was a nazi, but he took the party to an extremist level unlike others. Nazis just believe in natural order.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">"    Some parts of that are true. At schools in the USA ive realised usually everyone stays with their race. At lunch mexicans stay with mexicans; Blacks sometimes mix with whites. Its like we were all built to place somewhere. Its like we think it "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">shouldnt be like that, but it just naturally happens.

2. Polynesia is racist

    Actually they are quite ok with other races. People here make racist jokes every now and then because people see them that way.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">"The swastikas are meant to scare off ignorant people also to show Polynesia is National Socialist. Before you say nat. soc. is bad read more detail about the party not medias point of view."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">3. Im a Communist who believes that some of National Socialism is true.

  The socialism part in the term has nothing to do with left wing. From internet reading nat. soc. is not left nor right wing. They are in the middle of authoritarion.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">"   Me being a Democratic Communist I have an opened mind about that races and people act in a natural world. I believe that its human nature for hierarchy and races stay with their race (usually). Nazis point out the problems and Hitler tried a cure."</div></div>
