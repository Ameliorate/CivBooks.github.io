<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>-------------------Now when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">the letters<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>of the alphabet I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>too. I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived. All<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the majestic river!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content"> I still kept in<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling upon the<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling rings that were as<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>many-tinted as an opal;  where the ruddy flush was faintest was a smooth spot</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">hat was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>traced; the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the somber shadow that<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>silver;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content"> and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">soft distances, and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>steadily, enriching it every passing moment with new marvels of coloring.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river’s face;</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>came when I ceased altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>repeated, I should have looked upon it without rapture and should have commented<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>upon it inwardly after this fashion:</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>have wind tomorrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>somebody’s steamboat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that;<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>place is shoaling up</div></div>

No, the romance and beauty were all gone from the river. All the value any
