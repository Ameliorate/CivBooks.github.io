 Once a child turned 16, they began working in the mines with their parents to search for diamonds and iron. 
 

Jorg was no different.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 7</a><div class="page-content"> On the night of his 16th birthday, Jorg's grandfather unexpectedly called him to sit by the fire. 
 "I have something that I need to tell you before you go to the mines," he said. 
 "What is it, Grandpa?" Jorg asked. His grandfather rarely spoke anymore,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 7</a><div class="page-content">and least of all this late at night. 
 "You must remember to never, ever, dig straight down."
 "But Grandpa, why not? If I dig straight down, I'll surely dig find my way to diamonds much more quickly!"
 The old man's face grew dark and</div></div>

 Once at the mine, he was given a few torches and told to follow one of the more experienced miners, Hal, to learn the</div></div>

 Hal was built like an ox and had the intellect to match, but seemed nice enough. He beckoned Jorg over to him and held out a hand the size of a dinner plate. 
 "Name Hal. Happy to meet new friend," he managed. 
 "Hello, Hal, I'm Jorg</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 7</a><div class="page-content">I'm new." Jorg held his own hand out and immediately felt his entire hand and forearm enveloped in Hal's crushing grasp.
 "Ok, good," Hal grunted, freeing Jorg's arm. "You follow down."</div></div>
