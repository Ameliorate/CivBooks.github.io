<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 48</a><div class="page-content">There once was a boy named Stimpy. He was a lonely peasant that lived in a little house outside of Orion. He usually spent his days harvesting carrots and feeding cows. He didn't usually travel into the big city of Orion because it was much too busy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The city was scary to him, with all the men who wandered about in their weird glowing armor. These men would hassle Stimpy for being a wee farmer boy. The armored men had the best gear while poor Stimpy had nothing but his carrots and stone tools.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy didn't always want to be a farmer. At a young age Stimpy had been curious about the warrior lifestyle, but he never got the opportunity to train to fight.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He was sent off to work the field by his displeased masters, Theodius and Norami, just for being in the way. However, being a farmer boy did have its perks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He enjoyed the peace and quiet, and he also liked that he did not have to worry about learning big city things. He had a pretty good life. That is... up until weird things started happening.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The morning started like any other. The young farmer boy ate some bread, milked the pigs, and went about the daily task of bringing a load of carrots into the bustling town of Orion. He noticed nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The town was empty. (Although, one never truly knows all that is going on in the town.) He traveled further in toward the center of the town to deliver his carrots to a drop-off chest provided by the town's leader, Itaqi.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He placed his cargo of carrots into a chest to receive payment for his harvest. He called out, "Y'all here? Anybody?" There was no answer. It was spooky.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy walked toward the rail station as that was a place that was normally buzzing with the activity of people traveling to and from Orion. He entered and found no one. He decided to walk down one of the empty tracks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The further he went down into the tunnels the colder it got. He called out again, "Y'all here?" This time he got an answer, but it was very quiet. The voice was crackly, and came with heavy breathing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy walked toward the source of the sound and discovered a gruesome sight. It was Clone2204 smashed between piles of cobblestone. Clone was lying at an awkward angle with his head pinned to the cold ground.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy walked over and started to remove the rubble that was crushing Clone. He stopped when he heard Clone's broken voice again. In a quiet voice Clone stated that he was dying and was about to leave this world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He said that he wanted Stimpy to save himself and flee the area. Stimpy refused and said, "But Clone, if I don't help you, y'all won't be there later to keep me safe." Stimpy continued to remove the cobble. Clone laughed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 48</a><div class="page-content">It hurt to laugh, and he started to cough and spit up blood. Clone knew he didn't have much longer to live. He said, "Stimpy, you have to listen to me. They were here and they did this to me. I tried stopping them, but there were too many.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Your friends are in the End. Everybody from Civcraft is pearled. They are all being held by bloodidiot and zerorussia. You are the only one that can save them."  
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Stimpy said, "Y'all know I can't fight."</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Clone stared into Stimpy's eyes and replied, "You have to protect yourself." Clone grunted in pain. "Stimpy, take my armor and sword. Take everything. You will need it." Clone gave all of his combat gear to Stimpy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy cried, "Don't die, Clone." A tear ran down his face.
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Clone whispered, "Save them."</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Stimpy continued to cry. "You know I can't, Clone."</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Clone said, "Yes you can. I believe in you." With his last breath he said, "Stimpy, do it for Civcraft." Clone drifted off and was no more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy started running as fast as his little legs could carry him. He ran without looking back until he found himself back inside his house. Stimpy ran straight to his bed and laid down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He thought about everything that just happened and wondered what to do. His future looked bleak. He decided to wait until the morning to decide what path to take. In the morning he would feel better and have a clearer head.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He stood up, went outside to feed his animals, and returned to bed. He was exhausted and tried to sleep. He tossed and turned. Eventually his weariness overcame his troubled thoughts, and Stimpy drifted off to sleep.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">In the morning Stimpy woke up and dragged himself out of bed. He looked around. Everything looked normal in his little oasis of a farm. His eyes eventually came upon Clone's once gleaming armor and sword that was now piled in the corner of his room.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">A tear trickled down Stimpy's face. He grabbed the armor and put it on. Surprisingly it was not heavy. The magical armor felt quite comfortable. He picked up Clone's legendary sword and looked at it. Stimpy knew that this sword was strong.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The enchanted sword felt great in his palm. It gave him confidence. A flash of resolve came over him. He knew he could make a difference. Stimpy decided to test this newfound feeling. He walked outside and eyed up the nearby scarecrow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">A smile came over Stimpy's face. He walked over and started swinging at the straw figure. Stimpy liked the power that flowed from the magical equipment through him. He felt immortal. He moved back and forth in his yard, swinging the sword as he went.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He did this all day - until the sun started to set. When the sun disappeared below the horizon, he started to tire. He was exhausted and hungry. His tired body seemed to cancel out the exhilarating effects of the magical equipment,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">and Stimpy now noticed that it was quite dark. He started to became scared and turned back towards his home. Just beyond the tree near his door Stimpy noticed a skeleton turn and see him. The skeleton was starting to pull back the string on its bow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy froze in his tracks. However, the shock of seeing the skeleton brought a rush of adrenaline. Stimpy could feel the power returning. He charged at the undead archer. An arrow flew towards him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Unbelievably, Stimpy split it midair with a flick of his sword. He reached the skeleton before it had a chance to fetch another arrow from its quiver. Stimpy slashed right and left and the skeleton was no more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">With a smile on his face, Stimpy picked up a bone remnant from the ground and went into his home. He prepared some food and reflected on the events of the last couple days.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy felt confident that he might possibly have a chance to do something meaningful. He never thought he would feel this good. He had always been too scared in the past. After his meal, Stimpy headed towards his bed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He took off the shiny armor. As good as it felt on him, he knew that he would never get a good night's rest with the magical energy from the armor flowing though his body. He was exhausted and needed a solid night of sleep.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">As he drifted off to sleep he felt the fear within him returning. He was a bit scared thinking about the dangers he might face tomorrow. He know he would have to travel away to face danger - away from the safe routes he knew near his home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Nevertheless, Stimpy was happy he would get a chance to do something meaningful and legendary. He drifted off with a smile on his face.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy woke up the next day feeling refreshed. He ate a big steak for breakfast and put on the enchanted armor. He picked up the sword and potions and started making the trek into Orion. He was changed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The farmer boy strode with confidence. He wanted all of the bad people to know that he was a force to be reckoned with. Stimpy arrived into Orion and started to investigate the disappearance of the population.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He walked around for many hours looking for anything helpful that could provide a clue to where they had gone. He eventual discovered some movement - a shadow off in the distance that was moving.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy pulled out his sword and cautiously tracked the dark figure. The shadow sensed it was being followed, and it spoke. Stimpy could not understand the speech, but he thought he recognized the shape.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">The shadow continued speaking and then stopped abruptly. It clapped its hands together and, with a flash of light, the shadow disappeared. A shimmering word appeared in its wake: "Nine."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy was very confused. He could have sworn that he knew who the figure was, but he wasn't certain - it felt like someone from the distant past. Stimpy questioned his own sanity. Maybe he didn't get enough rest last night?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy brushed off the thought, and continued to look for clues. He headed towards the capitol building where he found an unlocked chest and opened it to find one minecart. Stimpy took the minecart and went off to a nearby inn to find a bed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">This time he did not take the armor off. He crawled into the bed and slept. He started to have a pleasing dream. The dream was a flashback to his old farmer's way of life. He felt content and a smile appeared on his face.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Soon though, Stimpy seemed to feel the shadow's presence. He woke up with a start. There was a thunderstorm going on outside. When the lightning flashed, he could see out the window that the shadow was floating in the air off in the distance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Stimpy stepped out of the bed and crossed the room to the window. The shadow couldn't be seen anymore. It had disappeared. Stimpy knew he wouldn't be able to sleep anymore and decided to move on with his investigations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 48</a><div class="page-content">He headed out into the rain and walked towards the rail station. Soon he arrived at the station. While he was considering the many destination possibilities, the shadowy figure caught Stimpy's eye.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 48</a><div class="page-content">It was disappearing down the rail line that went to Carson. Stimpy now knew which way he had to go, and he set off to follow the mysterious apparition.</div></div>
