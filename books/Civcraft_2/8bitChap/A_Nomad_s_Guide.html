 ➡ This is so crap. Give me back my cash!

 ➡ Wow such a scam!

 ➡ It helped me! not.
 
 ➡ 0/10 would bang

 ➡ 10/10 meh - IGN</div></div>

So you want to make it big using your nomadic life style choices to turn a profit? 

STOP. STOP NOW.

You are most certainly not going to turn a substantial profit with this lifestyle. It won't</div></div>

investment in a shop or business would bring.

Getting the best deals on trades is all about your charisma, connection,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">social appearance. If you're an arse to people don't be surpised if they perceive you as such.  

Who are you most likely to give a favour to? A new found friend with interesting stories to tell or a moody, bland statistic that just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">happened upon you? I assume the former.

Onto apperance, first look is everything. If you go up to a potential trade deal wearing your suit of shining armour and try to come across as poor to get a 'pity deal' then you're gonna have a bad time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">      ⋆Chapter 2⋆

Patience is key when trading: get to know the person, get to know what you are buying or selling, plan to invest, think about the re-sale value and the availability of the product; if you're investing in a higher quality product.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 3⋆

Remember who your friends are. With your lifestyle as a nomad you're going to meet alot of people. Alot of nice people, a few not so nice. 

Revist your new friends. Not only does this reinforce the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">method you learnt about in "Chapter 1", it also builds your social apperance, gets you connected into the town or community that person lives in. 

Do them favours and they'll do you favours. They gave you something for free? Repay the dept!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 4⋆

Starting small? Dream small. Civcraft is about making your way up in the world through servitude, community integration. If you're offering bogus deals you're most likely going to be declined.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 5⋆

Pick your towns. Sure, go out, explore the world but inactive towns serve as only a pretty memoriam. If you're bothered about turning a profit wherever you go then stick to the active places.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">        ⋆Chapter 6⋆

Invest wisely. Don't be hasty about your investments unless you want to make decisions you'll regret.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 7⋆

Don't rip people off. Maybe this is a moral dilemma I face but I don't feel content when I get a deal that isn't fair for both parties. This relates back to the social appearance point and how you're perceived.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 8⋆

Profit isn't always physical. You could do a favour for someone. For example: dig out a bit of land for them, help them with a task, do a quick delivery, give them directions. Chances are they'll remember this and do you favours too.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 9⋆

Not everything has to be traded for, it's okay to ask for free items. Just remember your depts and, as stated previously, remember who your friends are.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 16</a><div class="page-content">       ⋆Chapter 10⋆

Always carry the fantastic book "A nomad's guide to Seeking oppurtunity." 

You never know when it might come in handy!</div></div>
