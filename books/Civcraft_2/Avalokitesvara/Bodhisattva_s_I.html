la
Respectfully I prostrate myself to the Sugatas Who are endowed with the Dharmakaya,   As well as to their Noble Sons
And to all who are worthy of veneration.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 37</a><div class="page-content">lb
Here I shall explain how to engage in the vows of the Buddhasʹ Sons,
The meaning of which I have condensed in accordance with the scriptures.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 2
There is nothing here that has not been explained before And I have no skill in the art of rhetoric;
Therefore, lacking any intention to benefit others, I write this in order to acquaint it to my mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 37</a><div class="page-content">3
For due to acquaintance with what is wholesome,
The force of my faith may for a short while increase because of these (words). If, however, these (words) are seen by others
Equal in fortune to myself, it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 37</a><div class="page-content">may be meaningful (for them).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> perfect opportunity come about again?

Just as a flash of lightning on a dark, cloudy night For an instant brightly illuminates all,
Likewise in this world, through the might of Buddha, A wholesome thought rarely and briefly appears.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 37</a><div class="page-content">6
Hence virtue is perpetually feeble,
The great strength of evil being extremely intense. And except for a Fully Awakening Mind
By what other virtue will it be overcome?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 37</a><div class="page-content">

All the Buddhas who have contemplated for many aeons
Have seen it to be beneficial;
For by it the limitless masses of beings
Will quickly attain the supreme state of bliss.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 37</a><div class="page-content">8
Those who wish to destroy the many sorrows of (their) conditioned existence, Those who wish (all beings) to experience a multitude of joys,
And those who wish to experience much happiness, Should never</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 37</a><div class="page-content">forsake the Awakening Mind.

The moment an Awakening Mind arises
In those fettered and weak in the jail of cyclic existence, They will be named ʹa Son of the Sugatasʹ,
And will be revered by both men and gods of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 37</a><div class="page-content">the world.
10
It is like the supreme gold‐making elixir,
For it transforms the unclean body we have taken Into the priceless jewel of a Buddha‐Form Therefore firmly seize this Awakening Mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 37</a><div class="page-content">11
Since the limitless mind of the Sole Guide of the World Has upon thorough investigation seen its preciousness,  All beings wishing to be free from worldly abodes    Should firmly take hold of this precious Awakening Mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 37</a><div class="page-content">12
All other virtues are like the plantain tree;   For after bearing fruit they simply perish.    But the perennial tree of the Awakening Mind
Unceasingly bears fruit and thereby flourishes without end.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 37</a><div class="page-content">13
Like entrusting myself to a brave man when greatly afraid
By entrusting myself to this (Awakening Mind) I shall be swiftly liberated Even if I have committed extremely unbearable evils.
Why then do the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 37</a><div class="page-content">conscientious not devote themselves to this?14
Just like the fire at the end of an age,
It instantly consumes all great evil.
Its unfathomable advantages were taught
To the disciple Sudhana by the wise Lord Maitreya.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 37</a><div class="page-content">15
In brief, the Awakening Mind
Should be understood to be of two types; The mind that aspires to awaken
And the mind that ventures to do so.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 37</a><div class="page-content">16
As is understood by the distinction   Between aspiring to go and (actually) going. So the wise understand in turn
The distinction between these two.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 37</a><div class="page-content">17
Although great fruits occur in cyclic existence From the mind that aspires to awaken,
An uninterrupted flow of merit does not ensue As it does with the venturing mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 37</a><div class="page-content">18
And for him who has perfectly seized this mind With the thought never to turn away
From totally liberating The infinite forms of life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 37</a><div class="page-content">19
From that time hence,
Even while asleep or unconcerned A force of merit equal to the sky Will perpetually ensue.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 37</a><div class="page-content">20
For the sake of those inclined towards the lesser (vehicle), This was logically asserted
By the Tathagata himself
In The Sutra Requested by Subahu</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 21
If even the thought to relieve
Living creatures of merely a headache Is a beneficial intention
Endowed with infinite goodness,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 22
Then what need is there to mention
The wish to dispel their inconceivable misery, Wishing every single one of them
To realise boundless good qualities?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 23
Do even fathers and mothers
Have such a benevolent intention as this? Do the gods and sages?
Does even Brahma have it?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 24
If those beings have never before Even dreamt of such an attitude
 
For their own sake,
How would it ever arise for the sake of others?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 25
This intention to benefit all beings,
Which does not arise in others even for their own Is an extraordinary jewel of the mind,
And its birth is an unprecedented wonder.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 37</a><div class="page-content">26
How can I fathom the depths
Of the goodness of this jewel of the mind, The panacea that relieves the world of pain And is the source of all its joy?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 37</a><div class="page-content">27
If merely a benevolent intention Excels venerating the Buddhas,
Then what need to mention striving to make
All beings without exception happy?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 28
Although wishing to be rid of misery, They run towards misery itself.  Although wishing to have happiness, Like an enemy they ignorantly destroy it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 37</a><div class="page-content">29
For those who are deprived of happiness And burdened with many sorrows
It satisfies them with all joys, Dispels all suffering,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 37</a><div class="page-content">
30
And clears away confusion.    Where is there a comparable virtue? Where is there even such a friend? Where is there merit similar to this?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 37</a><div class="page-content"> 31
If whoever repays a kind deed Is worthy of some praise,
Then what need to mention the Bodhisattva Who does good without its being asked of him?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 37</a><div class="page-content">32
The world honours as virtuous
A man who sometimes gives a little, plain food Disrespectfully to a few beings,
That satisfies them for only half a day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 37</a><div class="page-content">33
What need be said then of one
Who eternally bestows the peerless bliss of the Sugatas Upon limitless numbers of beings,
Thereby fulfilling all their hopes?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 37</a><div class="page-content">34
The Buddha has said that whoever bears an evil thought Against a benefactor such as that Bodhisattva
Will remain in hell for as many aeons As there were evil thoughts.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 37</a><div class="page-content">35
But if a virtuous attitude should arise (in that regard). Its fruits will multiply far more than that.
When Bodhisattvas greatly suffer they generate no negativity, Instead their virtues naturally increase.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 37</a><div class="page-content">36
I bow down to the body of him
In whom the sacred precious mind is born. I seek refuge in that source of joy
Who brings to happiness even those who harm him.</div></div>
