<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 7</a><div class="page-content">Many years ago, an old childless woman was washing her clothes in a steam. She did this everyday, but that day was different. She looked up and, to her surprise, found a giant peach floating down the stream. As it passed her, thinking it would be the most</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 7</a><div class="page-content">delisious thing she'll ever taste. She rushed home, put the peach on the table, and grabbed a knife to cut it. But when she cut the peached, it opened and revealed a baby boy! The old woman teared up and picked up the boy. She called him "Momotaro"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 7</a><div class="page-content">which means "peach boy".

The old woman raised Momotaro to be strong and couragous. Then one day, ogres attacked the nearby village and stole everything of value. Furious at the ogre, Momotaro decided to go to Ogre Island</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 7</a><div class="page-content">and take back what they stole. The old woman gave Momotaro her father's sword and some dumplings for the long trip. Along the way, Momotaro met a dog, monkey, and phesent who joined him in his quest after being given a dumpling.</div></div>

Momotaro and his partners attacked fiercely, slaying one hundred ogres. When they reached the ogre king, he saw the strength of Momotaro and gave</div></div>

Victorious, Momotaro and his partners returned to the mainland, returning all the stolen goods to their rightfull owners. He invited the dog, monkey, and phesent to live with him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 7</a><div class="page-content">and they happily agreed. They returned to Momotaro's house and were welcomed with the warm imbrace of the old woman who was proud of her son. And they lived as one big, happy family.
