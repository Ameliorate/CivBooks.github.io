I wake up in an unfimiliar place...I go in hunt of a place called Mount Augustis in search of a home. On my way I am detected by the khan of Good Springs, who offers me food, which I politely decline as Lade has found me first.</div></div>

I immediately begin my journey in civcraft by working as labor. I find myself filling up a double chest of sand for a block of diamond...I would have done it for less."</div></div>

I find a spider spawner. Due to lack of gear I seek out the help of my trusty pal Prof. We end up finding at least five spider spawners in close proximity to one another. I have found a way to generate a steady income and am</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 3

I died to the spawners multiple times today. I forgot to reset my bed after moving to a bigger apartment curtesy of Ladez. So, needless to say, I had  a fun time getting back to Mount Augusta. Prof and I managed to get some solid work done .</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 37</a><div class="page-content">It turns out only 3 of the spawners were in range of each other. Things are starting to pan out.

<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 4

I played a lot today. Did more work on the spawners with Prof. Got a nice room dug out and have gotten most of the materials needed. I was invited to participate in something called a farley war. It was an absolute blast. We were successful</div></div>

Today I went to the wedding of screenname and certainty. The ceremony was nice and many "danks" were said throughout the ceremony. I congratulated them and went on my way. I had a carrot before I left for the run home.</div></div>

Prof is out of town. I find myself collecting double chests of carrots, potatos, and other various edibles. I find myself not doing much due to lack of people around. This boredom was ended by Ladezkik taking me around town. We had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 37</a><div class="page-content">a nice little snowball fight and played a round of mini golf. I lost by one on the last hole, but it was pretty fun. We added little shacks to the slums, which was also fun.

I haven't been keeping up with this book. In the past few days I have done some fun things. I made xp for the first time. I feel like I actually accomplished something.

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 15,

I need to keep up with this book better. I am becoming forgettful to write in this. I found a diamond vein and have been digging it out the past few days. I paid Ladezkik to build me a fancy house and boy does it look good. Its not finished yet,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 37</a><div class="page-content">but it will look pretty amazing when its done. I can't wait to get out of this tiny cramped apartment.

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 16

I pretty much mined my diamond vein all day today. I have a nice amount of wealth right now for a new friend. I almost don't trust my one layer vault to keep my diamonds. For now I keep them in my inventory when I log for safe keeping.</div></div>

I\u0027m not too sure how to spend my wealth. I gave some to Mt. Augusta via Programmer Dan. I gave some to Prof for showing me around and helping me out. I invested in the local xp business. I still have "</div></div>

I mostly just enjoy the company "</div></div>

Getting back into the swing of things with writing in this book. I showed cave how to do some stuff and showed her around a bit. We had a short, but good time playing today. My house is coming along and is really looking good. I am a tad</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 37</a><div class="page-content">drunk writing this so if this isn't a good log my apologies. I hope to invest in more local activities in the future. I also hope to travel to more cities. I visited Thule not too long ago
and while the city is still under construction I was  blown away.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 18

I had a late night chat with our Lord Mayor ProgrammerDan. I think together we can achieve great things together. We have planned on adding prot factories to MAFO. A good starting point in attempting to contribute more to</div></div>

I got the factories installed with ProgrammerDan. I have not used them yet. I told Dan I wish to remain an anonymous donor for now...for my own sake and because I don't need extra attention as a new friend. I went to Orion</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 37</a><div class="page-content">to work on digging for Shaded, but I died twice and gave up.

<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 20

I went back and got my stuff from Orion. I immediately headed back to Mount Augusta. I was attacked by Mejesta, but his arrows didn't hit me. I am thankful for his horrible aim and my "doging" skills. 
- Newman_19</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 37</a><div class="page-content">Day 21

I can't believe it has been three weeks already on this glorious server. Today I had my first bit of pvp, if you can even call it that. The one they call Mejesta griefed New Detroit and a few Mount Augusta citizens,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 37</a><div class="page-content">"myself included, aided them. Mejesta was easily pearled. It happened so fast I didn\u0027t even get a proper hit in. My adrenaline was pumping non-the-less. I don\u0027t think I have a future in pvp, but I have a hatred for griefers that runs deep. I hope to talk "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 37</a><div class="page-content">"to Dan today about other projects that I can invest in for the greater good of Mount Augusta. I believe this may be the last entry for this book. Thirty four pages is a bit of a long read for minecraft. Hopefully this first book/journal has kept you "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 37</a><div class="page-content">entertained. By the time this book is published these writings shall be old news. I hope those that were on at the time of its writing are still here to read it some day...

Things have been crazy the past two days. I made prot and got sold some. logged in yesterday and was told by Ladezkik that my house had been griefed. I ran back as fast as I could. In the distance I could see</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 37</a><div class="page-content">a dirt tower used for entry. There were two broken doors and some cobble grief. My official welcome to the server. I'm updating my security. Thanks for reading.
