<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">deep love and understanding for him. On the first day of their meeting the man whom had come made argument with brother Supra but he responsded not with hatred but with an open mind and an open heart to him.
