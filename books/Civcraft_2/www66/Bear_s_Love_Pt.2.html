<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The morning sun rose, casting bright yellow light on a sleeping Ruby's eyes, her face twitching awake. Bear Turned to her, a wide smile on his face, the smaller lover had curled their back against his chest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">With a delightful stretch and deep, resounding yawn, he rose up, rubbing the back of his head before looking back over to his love "Sweetheart, it's time to wake up." she tossed and pulled the blankets over her head in response.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Pausing, bear scooped Ruby up into his arms, still wrapped in their bed sheets "Too bad, we've got to get clean after last night". Ruby mumbles, almost inaudible as she pulls the blanket off her head "<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Fine...but<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> it needs to be a bath".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The pair reach the bathroom, Ruby's half naked body, barely covered by one of Bear's t-shirts, was now sitting on the edge of the steaming, slowly filling shower tub. A fully kommando Bear was sinking his feat in, helping her take off his shirt,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content"> admiring the curves along her back and posterior.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> Bear slid down into the tub, pulling his sweet lover onto his lap, submerging her up to her chest, strong hands rubbing along her chest as she began to clean his morning wood by hand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Bear's deep vocals vibrated through his chest, sounds of joy and relaxation as Ruby worked her gentle hands along his body, washing his member and package, turning around to wash his chest and front, stopping to allow him the same pleasure,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">smiling between little moans as he worked a thorough hand between tight thighs. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A strong arm makes its way around Ruby from behind, then another, lifting her up carefully, the sound of falling water a distant echo as Bear turns her around,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">his thick, pink, throbbing meat resting between her round cheeks.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Sounds of mating echo in the tiled washroom, Bear rubbing his cock tip on Ruby's sweet hole,spreading pre-cum like cosmoline in the workings of a slav rifle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">As he felt she was lubed enough, Bear slid himself in, grunting, ears focused on the moans and groans of his sweetheart.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The length of his ramming rod stretched out Ruby's sweet breech, pumping in and out, the sound of thigh slapping against round, jiggly ass.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Rhythmic thrusting speeds up as they both get closer to climax,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content"> Bear all the while stroking Ruby's cute little cock, bliss taking over their actions, their minds swollen with pleasure.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Cum fills Ruby's now sore ass, her body lax against bear as he picks her up once more,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">turning her to face him, his lips held against hers for a moment,only break away to catch his breathe "I love <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>you...Don't<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> ever forget that." Bear speaks sternly, with passion in his heart, Ruby can only nod and hug herself close to him,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content"> humming a happy melody.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
