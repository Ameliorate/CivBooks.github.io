So, where does Leninism stand in all of this? Well comrades, after much work</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 19</a><div class="page-content">and research, I have re-evaluated my life and identified a solution. Leninism must move into the 21st century, a 21st century Leninism one might say. The ideology of Leninism maintains many of the same ideas, mixed with a new heterodoxical economic</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">policy. Leninism remains anti-monarchical as well as anti-capitalist. However, Leninism isn't anti-market, in fact, Leninism supports the worker's ability to control the means of financial production. The people determine the ways and means of demand and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">supply, with the oversight of a central authority of course, who channel the interest of those very workers. Leninism continues to propose a governmental conception of a People's Government, represented by the Intelligentsia, who are elected by the wind</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">of revolutionary action. Through those actions includes the leader who shall lead the workers to victory and establish the intelligentsia to run the state. The leader must be a man of the people but a man nonetheless. As a result, the leader must be as</div></div>

Make t-shirts, post likes on facebook, tweet pictures, spreading the glorious leader's image to a wider audience. The leader must write manifesto on his or her's exploit to great</div></div>

An ideology must have a face and as such, the face of the revolution must be a face of the Glorious Leader him/herself! This will be the way in which Leninism survives the scourge of technology.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Now, economically. Leninism will remain centralized in the means of production, with the addage of a currency model, controlled by the people! However, the currency model will vary between would-be Glorious Leaders. Regardless, having a currency</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">provides additional prosperity. It's a matter of simple economics, the more currency a state has, the better! If the 21st century has taught us anything, printing trillions of dollars can push any country forward towards economic domination.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Now, as in the past, Leninism remains inherently pro-civilian government, identifying the workers who have proven themselves in the fields tilling the land, or on the fields of revolutionary struggle. The Intelligentsia are ministers, who have little to</div></div>

Your ministers are the intelligentsia, it's that simple comrade. Finally, 21st Century Leninism and you! So, you want to be the next Glorious</div></div>

Well, the following pages will provide a simple straightforward method to achieving this goal. First off, it's all about motivation.

Great, now use your local social media networks to begin a series of one page image macros describing in the most simple details showcasing why your current government is systemically violent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Afterwards, get a following on the twitter or the google and begin organizing protests. Remember, always be sure to identify comrades who you can trust with your life! These most devoted members will becom the intelligentsia at a later point. Soon, you</div></div>
