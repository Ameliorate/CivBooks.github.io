Mc ran away as fast as she could, which isn't actually that fast. She ran in to memod along the way, and memod ran away too, because that's the only thing he knows how to do. Memod came back to his</div></div>

"I wonder where I should go be a gigantic weenie next," thought memod. "Maybe I should go burn down the Hexagon. xD, I bet they'll think I'm hilarious."

For memod, a new day meant a new butt plug. "aaaahhhhh" sighed memod. The new day was already looking bright. He pondered at how he was going to pull off this magnificent plan. How</div></div>

He then came to the"</div></div>
