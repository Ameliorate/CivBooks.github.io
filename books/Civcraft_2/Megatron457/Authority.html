     Authority is
     Oppression

These governments are total, and, at least attempt, to control every aspect of their citizen\u0027s lives. From early society with tribes to the totalitarianism seen in"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">the USSR and Hitler's Germany. These societies were totally controlled by their governments and served as little better than slaves to the leaders.
  The citizens of these societies have no freedoms- no free speech, press, religion, etc.- they are deemed</div></div>

In the eyes of libertarians, though, the existance of such a system is a crime against humanity. Fascist-type governments present a means of oppression of all under the state, to unify its people under themselves, the"</div></div>

In Hitler\u0027s Germany, this was the Jews and in Stalin\u0027s Russia, this was anyone Stalin thought was against him. They both killed millions of innocent people, uniting the state"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">through fear.
  These governments would, and have, kill millions of their own people, they would brainwash their populations, and they would terrify them just to control them. Removing their rights to make saying anything bad about the state illegal.</div></div>

Many alleged criminals didn\u0027t have a trail, and were punished without evidence saying they commited a crime. These are governments of unfari treatment, inequality, and oppression.

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">leaders of these countries lived like gods, at the expense of the people under them.
  The worst part, though, is that many times, these leaders are put in power by the people. By the hungry, the poor, and the broken who the leaders promised</div></div>

  A saying I once heard goes:
"Authority is oppression, Liberty on the other hand, is as free as the air we all breathe."</div></div>
