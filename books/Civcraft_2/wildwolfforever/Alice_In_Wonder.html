I woke up and rubbed my eyes. "Morning" I said to my younger brother Ezio, who was also waking up. "Mummy and Daddy were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 11</a><div class="page-content">fighting again" he said blankly. "I know" I said sadly, getting out of bed and giving him a hug. We walked into out of our room and into the kitchen/our parents bedroom. They were planning on building a basement and an ustairs soon. "Morning honeys!" Mum</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">said cheerily. "Morning" I said. Dad was silent. We ate our breakfast in silence, an awkward tension in the air. "I'm gona go play in the village!" announced Ezio when we were finished. "Have fun, but be careful walking there, monstors could still be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">out there" said mum clearing away the plates. I followed Ezio outside. It was a lovely day, the sun was shining, the ocean was gleaming, our chickens were clucking and sheep baaing, it was paradise. I slowly walked, enjoying the day while Ezio ran ahead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Suddenly, a scream broke the peace. "EZIO!" I yelled, snapping out of my daze and charging ahead. He was cornered about 3 zombies, all on burning but still putting up a fight. For his namesake Ezio was suppost to be good with a sword, but he was still</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">young and inexperienced. One of the zombies advanced, reaching out its decaying green hand to hit him. I drew my shabby stone sword from its holister and charged into the crowd. One of the zombies smashed its great lump of a hand into my hair, setting it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">on fire but that was the least of my concearns, sure Ezio and I had our fights but he was my brother, and I loved him. I could see him stuggling to fight off the other to zombies, his hood fallen back and sweat poring down his face as his cloak caught</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">fire. I lunged my sword into the zombie I was fighting, luckily killing it rushed to help him. I began fighting off one but my cloths started to catch fire. I then heard someone running towards us, yelling. It was mum! "I'm coming!" she yelled, drawing</div></div>

She was to late though, Ezio collapsed, to exausted to continue. I watched, frozen by fear as a zombie shuffled forward and dilivered the final blow. I was to shocked to scream, to cry out, to even more to defend myself as</div></div>

"No!" screamed mum, bursting into tears as she sliced the zombie who had killed my brothers head off. She lunged forward towards the zombie that was attacking me but she was again, to late. I watched, horrorstruck,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">as the zombie smashed his great, burning, hand into my face, and it all faded to black.

I was dead.</div></div>
