A Tale of Four Cities.

  FeenixPhire waited in the rain as gabeknight, founder of Agraria, welcomed him into the city. Given a small plot, Feenix walked across the city of Agraria-his new home.
  "Hey there," said Makanla, the nextdoor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 39</a><div class="page-content">neighbor of Feenix. "I movd here tday as ewll u wanna learn how to shitpost// ;3 ;3"

"Uh, no thanks," said Feenix. He had spent most of his career wondering through the wilderness ignorant of the nations not 2 kilometers away.  He didn't even know what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 39</a><div class="page-content">the term 'shitpost' even was. He decided to ask Makanla for a few building supplies, and start building a tiny tower that he could call home. 

  Over the next few days, Feenix watched the pink glow of the horizon slowly become dark, and then light</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 39</a><div class="page-content">again from his balcony. Then, one day, he read an unintelligent moan extend from chat.

"oi m8," ejaculated Theodius. "gabe, u wunt, iny wud m8? I got me spruce, I got me birch, I got me oak."

"Is this a new mob?" proclaimed Feenix.</div></div>

"ur mum gives me wood."

"Yes, thank you Theo."</div></div>

All was well."</div></div>

  FeenixPhire continued to improve his building skills and learn about Civcraft, while Theodius panhandled the Agrarians while chopping down trees. For some reason, he believed that collecting the most abundant resource in Civcraft</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 39</a><div class="page-content">was a good business strategy.

  As Feenix picked flowers in the public garden, he felt a shake from the ground. Suddenly, a large drop of salt water landed in the road, shattering the blocks below it and knocking Feenix back.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"What was that?!" screamed Feenix like a little bitch.

"A Gordge..." said gabe. "I've heard about him. He's said to be so fucking fat, his cubic area smothers people the second he logs on. In fact, his sweat glands are 2 meters across. That explains</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 39</a><div class="page-content">the large bead of sweat."

"How fat are we talking here?"

"Why Gordge is so fat," exclaimed Theodius in his native tongue, "that every time he walks he Harlem Shakes. Gordge's gravitational pull is so great, that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 39</a><div class="page-content">not even light can escape. That's why his skin is pitch black. No light reflects off of him.

  Just then, a horrible shriek filled the air. Makanla began to spam ;3 in chat, as a way of telling Feenix to run. But it was too late. Blocks everywhere began</div></div>

Every step he took caused a deafening bang that caused Feenix\u0027s ears to ring. As Feenix was pulled towards the Black Gordge, he felt a hand reach out and grab him by his boots. The hand was Theo\u0027s. "</div></div>

In a final struggle to throw Feenix out of Gordge\u0027s range, Theo felt is footing slip. He was thrown into Gordge\u0027s mass, disappearing into the darkness.  As if the sacrifice was enough for Gordge, he "</div></div>

"NOOOOOOOOO!!!" cried Feenix. Distraught, he rushed over to the pearl, a shell that  was once a soul. Holding it tight, he weeped softly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 39</a><div class="page-content">A sudden discourse of rage flooded over him. In anger, Feenix threw Theo's pearl on the ground, causing it to shatter. 

"Fuck you Feenix, you really need to learn pearl mechanics," coughed out Theodius. Out of the blue, he had reappeared in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">place of the pearl. He had been freed!

"You should know that you can free someone if you have access to their pearl, you absolute fucking wanker." I had to sit their and listen to a bunch of fucking 2 year olds wank in chat. Sheesh."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"Oh Theo! Theo I can't believe you're alive. You saved my life. Thank you. Thank you <3."

"Feenix, you mean so much to me. We may not have been friends for long, but I felt a connection the moment we met. I instantly felt a void filled."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"What are you saying Theo?" asked Feenix, knowing the answer.

"Feenix.... I love you. I can't stop thinking about you.  And I know you feel the same way."

Feenix replied softly, bringing his hips up to Theo's. "Yes. I know. I love you too, Theo."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 39</a><div class="page-content">Feenix grabbed Theo's hips, and watched as Theo slowly stroked through his hair.

"You.... You wanna.. come to my house and do some P?" asked Theo.

"I think I'd like that," said Feenix.</div></div>

His vision blurred by the many hits of P, Feenix reached over to his lover, grasping his arm firmly but carefully. Theo reached to play with Feenix's nipples, only to be met by Feenix's tongue instead.</div></div>

Feenix then turned to Theo, and began to slip off Theo\u0027s pants. Watching Theo\u0027s cock throb, he was ready to finally show his gratitude. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"Back and forth he stroked the meaty cock, over and over again, causing Theo to spasm in pure pleasure. Pretty soon, the P took affect, and Feenix was able to feel the precum leak from Theo\u0027s hard on while Theo himself returned the favor-69 style. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 39</a><div class="page-content">"After what seemed like hours, Feenix entered a state of euphoria that took his entire body by storm. His muscles twitched, his face drooped, and he watched as Theo did the same. Locking eyes, Theo and Feenix came simultaneously. Feenix rolled off of Theo"</div></div>

It seemed like his entire world has ended and he was stuck in a phase of eternal pleasure. Theo began to kiss Feenix anywhere he could, before collasping on Feenix\u0027s chest. And for the first time in years,"</div></div>

Over the next few weeks, life attempted to return to normal. Feenix went on vacation and disappeared for a few weeks. In that time, Theodius, Mkanla;3, and a few new friends tried to renovate Danzilona.</div></div>

"No, Feenix, please. I</div></div>

In his grief from losing Feenix, Theodius fell into a deep depression, and tried to drown his sorrows in cheese sandwiches. But alas, the void was not filled. He needed Feenix. He rushed to the mumble to confront Feenix once and for all.</div></div>

I love you more than Gordge loves M&Ms. I love you more than when greg falls in holes. I love you more than JFK wanted a car with a roof. Don't you see? Without you, I'm dead inside." 

Feenix stared at him for a while.</div></div>
