it's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place in the side of our lives where nothing is ever put straight
She turns herself round and she smiles and she says 'This is it' 
'That's the end of the</div></div>

And her lovers walk through their coats
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
All of her lovers all talk of her notes and the flowers that they never sent</div></div>

Pretty in pink
The one who insists he was first in the line is the last to remember her name
He's walking around in this dress that she wore she is gone but the joke's the same

She gives you her clothes
These cars collide
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?</div></div>
