Chapter 1:

Burke sat in his house alone, waiting for his potions to cook. He heard people come by the fort earlier, spreading</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">propaganda about
some big revolution or resistance. He didn't really pay much attention. They were doomed to fail. The HCF had become far to powerful to overturn now. You'd just have to put up with them. "Those idiots are going to get someone killed!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"Exclaimed Burke, alone in his small house. He searched for a pickaxe, but remembered he had broken it finishing off the escape canal underneath the city. It was always good to have a backup plan, especially due to the fact that it was dangerous to even go"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">exploring. The other members of the Fort had agreed to meet up for a photo, but Burke had never really been the person to jump on the opportunity for a photo, so he just sat back on his bed, alone in his small house.

Chapter 2:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Burke could hear his friends returning from the photo location, and causing a large ruckus. He also heard shouting, but shook it off as just one of them playing around. He laid back down in his bed, looking at his brewing stand. His potions were done.
He</div></div>

invisibility potions, 2 
potions of swiftness
and 3 potions of regeneration. He was ecstatic about the result, but became annoyed again instantly by the loud shouting. It got louder, and louder as the culprite got closer</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"and closer. Burke grabbed and sharpened his sword to try and scare the person off. And as the shouting stopped, through the night sky, Burke saw someone he didn\u0027t recognise knocking on the door. In fact, knocking so hard, the door was being broken down..."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3:

Burke grabbed his sword and potions, and swung open the back door. He ran faster than he had ever run in his life. Could it be who he thought it was? He took a hesistant look back at the player chasing him, but didn't have enough time to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"get a name. He moved his legs faster than they had ever moved before, as he weaved in and out of buildings. He sprinted behind the wall of a church, and searched he bag frantically for an invis potion. He yanked one out and sculled it down. Gone. He"</div></div>

It was the HCF, they were here.

Chapter 4:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"Burke felt helpless. He couldn\u0027t do anything to save his friends, because if he tried to intervene he would surely be killed. And he didn\u0027t want to die by the hands of the HCF. He heard rumors that once they killed and imprisoned you, they would force you"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">"to work in labor camps or else your sentence was doubled. Burke knew he couldn\u0027t do anything, so he ran, past the HCf, down the secret passage hidden inside the fountain. He clambered down the ladder, to see a friend there, Zachary. They both travelled to"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">the canals, taking the right path to escape. Once they got out into the ocean, Burke and Zachary went seperate ways, taking their own path. Burke sailed for days, with nothing but the big blue ocean.

He was starving, and almost dead. he stumbled onto the shores, and a few people from a nearby town found him and fed him. He asked about the Fort, and they told him that everyone there was murdered and sent to work"</div></div>

Burke wanted to go back there, but the people warned him that the HCF would still be on the lookout for him, so he exiled himself, becoming a nomad for months, until finally moving on, leaving Fort Arrack "</div></div>
