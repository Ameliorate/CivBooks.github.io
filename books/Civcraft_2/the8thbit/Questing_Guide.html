<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Welcome to the Quest Board, comrade! Whether you're an aspiring citizen of Trenzalore or an old fogey who can't remember the rules because you have some sort of exotic old person brain disorder, you've come to the right place!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Quest Board is where citizens of Trenzalore come to pay tribute. What is paying tribute?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If you help out by building in town, defending the town, mining, or really doing anything helpful you're already doing so to an extent. The Quest Board is just a way to track those contributions.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Everyone who pays tribute of at least 200 'points' (you get points by completing the aforementioned tasks) becomes a citizen of Trenzalore. Citizens get to:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">* build houses behind the town wall
* add people to the guest group
* access the citizen storage (free stuff!)
* run for council
* start a shop in the bazaar</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Don't want to pay tribute? That's perfectly fine. If you decide not to you will stay in the guest group. Guests are welcome to build outside of the town wall.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">So how exactly do these quests work? Every guest must gain 200 points (200p) in order to become a citizen, and every citizen must gain 100 points (100p) per week to maintain their citizenship.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">To gain points, go down the aisles in the Quest Board floor and find a quest (listed on the signs above chests) which interestes you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Each quest sign will include the name of the quest, the amount of points the quest is worth, and the number of times the quest can be completed within a week in brackets.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If there is an X in the brackets it can be done infinite times. Example signs follow:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Mine 1d
10p [X]

Harvest Potatoes
5p [28]

Finish Gravel Road
Around Wall
15p [1]</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">When you find a quest you like, open the chest below its sign. You'll find a single book with a short description of the quest.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If there aren't already as many names as the number in brackets below the description, add your name and the date below like so:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the8thbit (05/30/2013-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Then go complete the quest. If your quest was to gather resources, put those resources in the hoppers in the main room. Once you complete it, come back and put the date of completion, like so:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">the8thbit (05/30/2013-05/31/2013)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Congratulations, you just got some points! You can use the other book in this chest to manage your total score for the week.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">As stated, you must get 100p per week in order to maintain your citizenship. If you fail to do this two weeks in a row, you will lose it and all of your benefits. You will then need to gain 200p in order to join the citizen group again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">On the Quest Board there are 5 labeled aisles: Resources, Land, Foreign Affairs, Other, and Community. The first four catagories are normal quests placed by council members. The Community Quests, however, are special.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Community Quests can by placed by *any* citizen. These postings are worth 5p each, and are always treated like they have a [1]. If the quest involves gathering resources, you give the resources to the other player instead of the  hoppers in the main room.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Because the point value and repeatability is contstant, instead of having those listed, the person who posted the quest will put their name on the second line. Example Community Quest:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Mine 16 quarts
the8thbit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Once you complete a Community Quest, please destroy its sign. You can then, if you'd like, put your own quest in its place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If you ever have a situation where you are not able to pay tribute a week (say you go on vacation, or you are very busy with other things that week) you can contact a council member, and we can consider and exception.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">And on the other end of things, feel free to exceed your tribute goal (200p/100p). We can use all of the mutual aid we can get, and any extra will be greatly apreciated.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If you have any other questions about the Quests Board, feel free to contact /u/the8thbit on reddit, the8thbit on CivCraft, or any of your current council members.</div></div>
