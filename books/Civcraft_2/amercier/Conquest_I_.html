CHAPTER III

ANARCHIST COMMUNISM

I.

In every society, on abolishing private property will be forced, we maintain,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"to organize itself on the lines of Communistic Anarchy. Anarchy leads to Communism, and Communism to Anarchy, both alike being expressions of the predominant tendency in modern societies, the pursuit of equality."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"Time was when a family could consider the corn it sowed and reaped, or the woolen garments woven in the cottage, as the products of its own soil. But even then this way of looking at things was not quite correct. There were roads and the bridges made in"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"common, the swamps drained by common toil, the communal pastures enclosed by hedges which were kept in repair by each and all. If the looms for weaving or the dyes for colouring fabrics were improved by somebody, all profited; and even in those days a"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 48</a><div class="page-content">peasant family could not live alone, but was dependent in a thousand ways on the village or the commune.

But nowadays, in the present state of industry, when everything is interdependent, when each branch of production is knit up</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"with all the rest, the attempt to claim an Individualist origin for the products of industry is absolutely untenable. The astonishing development of a thousand other industries, great and small, to the extension of the railroad system, to inter-oceanic"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 48</a><div class="page-content">navigation, to the manual skill of thousands of workers, to a certain standard of culture reached by the working class as a whole -- to the labours, in short, of men in every corner of the globe.

The Italians who died of cholera while</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"making the Suez Canal, or of anchylosis in the St. Gothard Tunnel, and the Americans mowed down by shot and shell while fighting for the abolition of slavery, have helped to develop the cotton industry of France and England, as well as the work-girls who"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 48</a><div class="page-content">languish in the factories of Manchester and Rouen, and the inventor who (following the suggestion of some worker) succeeds in improving the looms.

How then, shall we estimate the share of each in the riches which ALL contribute</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 48</a><div class="page-content">to amass?

Looking at production from this general, synthetic point of view, we cannot hold with the Collectivists that payment proportionate to the hours of labour rendered by each would be an ideal arrangement, or even a step in the right</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 48</a><div class="page-content">direction.

Without discussing whether exchange value of goods is really measured in existing societies by the amount of work necessary to produce it -- according to the teaching of Adam Smith and Ricardo, in whose footsteps Marx has</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"followed -- suffice it to say here, leaving ourselves free to return to the subject later, that the Collectivist idea appears to us untenable in a society which considers the instruments of labour as a common inheritance. Starting from this principle,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 48</a><div class="page-content">such a society would find itself forced from the very outset to abadon all forms of wages.

The migrated individualism of the Collectivist system certain could not maintain itself alongside a partial communism -- the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"socialisation of land and the instruments of production. A new form of property requires a new form of renumeration. A new method of production cannot exist side by side with the old forms of consumption, any more than it can adapt itself to the old forms"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 48</a><div class="page-content">of political organisation.

The wage system arises out of the individual ownership of the land and the instruments of labour. It was the necessary condition for the development of capitalist production, and will perish with it,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">in spite of the attempt to disguise it as "profit-sharing." The common possession of the instruments of labour must necessarily bring with it the enjoyment in common of the fruits of common labour.

We hold further that Communism is not only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"desirable, but that existing societies, founded on Individualism are inevitably impelled in the direction of Communism. The development of Individualism during the last three centuries is explained by the efforts of the individual to protect"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">himself from the tyranny of Capital and of the State. For a time he imagined, and those who expressed this thought for him declared, that he could free himself entirely from the State and from society. "By means of money," he said, "I can buy all that I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 48</a><div class="page-content">need." But the individual was on a wrong track, and modern history has taught him to recognize that, without the help of all, he can do nothing, although his strong-boxes are full of gold.

In fact, along this current of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Individualism, we find in all modern history a tendency, on the one hand, to retain all that remains of the partial Communism of antiquity, and, on the other, to establish the Communism principle in the thousand developments of modern life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"As soon as the communes of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries had succeeded in emancipating themselves from their lords, ecclesiastical or lay, their communcal labour and communal consumption began to extend and develop rapidly. The township"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"-- and not private persons -- freighted ships and equipped expeditions for the export of their manufacture, and the benefit arising from the foreign trade did not accrue to individuals, but was shared by all. At the outset, the townships also bought"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">provisions for all their citizens. Traces of these institutions have lingered on into the nineteenth century, and the people piously cherish the memory of them in their legends.

All that disappeared. But the rural township still struggles to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">preserve the last traces of this Communism, and it succeeds -- except when the State throws its heavy sword into the balance.

Meanwhile new organisations, based on the same principle -- to every man according to his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"needs -- spring up under a thousand different forms; for without certain leaven of Communism the present societies could not exist. In spite of the narrowly egoistic turn given to men\u0027s minds by the commercial system, the tendency towards Communism is"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">constantly appearing, and it influences our activities in a variety of ways.

The bridges, for the use of which a toll was levied in the old days, have become private property and are free to all; so are the high roads, except in the East, where a toll</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"is still extracted from the traveller for every mile of his journey. Museums, free libraries, free schools, free meals for children; parks and gardens open to all; streets paved and lighted, free to all; water supplied to every house without measure or"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">stint -- all such arrangements are founded on the principle: "Take was you need."

The tramways and railways have already introduced monthly and annual season tickets, without limiting the number of journeys taken; and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"two nations, Hungary and Russia, have introduced on their railways the zone system, which permits the holder to travel five hundred or eight hundred miles for the same price. It is but a short step from that to a uniform charge, such as already prevails"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"in the postal service. In all these innovations, and in a thousand others, the tendency is not to measure the individual consumption. One man wants to travel eight hundred miles, another five hundred. These are personal requirements. There is "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">no sufficient reason why one should pay twice as much as the other because his need is twice as great. Such are the signs which appear even now in our individualist societies.

Moreover, there is a tendency, though still a feeble one, to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"consider the needs of the individual, irrespective of his past or possible services to the community. We are beginning to think of society as a whole, each part of which is so intimately bound up with the others that a service is rendered to one is a"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 48</a><div class="page-content">service rendered to all.

When you go to a public library -- not indeed the National Library of Paris, but say, into the British Museum or the Berlin Library -- the librarian does not ask what services you have rendered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"to society before giving you the book, or the fifty books, which you require; he even comes to your assistance if you do not know how to manage the catalogue. By means of uniform credentials -- and very often a contribution of work is preferred -- the"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">scientific society opens its museums, its gardens, its library, its laboratories, and its annual conversaziones to each of its members, whether he be a Darwin, or a simple amateur.

At St. Petersburg, if you are elaborating</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"an invention, you go into a special laboratory, where you are given a place, a carpenter\u0027s bench, a turning lathe, all the necessary tools and scientific instruments, provided only you know how to use them; and you are allowed to work there as long as you"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">please. There are tools; interest others in your idea; join with fellow workers skilled in various crafts, or work alone if you prefer it. Invent a flying machine, or invent nothing -- that is your owna ffair. You are pursuing an idea -- that is enough.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"In the same way, those who man the lifeboat do not ask for credential sfrom the crew of a sinking ship; they launch their boat, risk their lives in the raging waves, and sometimes perish, all to save men whom they do not even know. And what need to know"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 48</a><div class="page-content">them? "They are human beings, and they need our aid -- that is enough, that establishes their right -- To the rescue!"

Thus, we find a tendency, eminently communistic, springing up on all sides, and in various guises, in the very heart of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">theoretically individualist societies.

Suppose that one of our great cities, so egoistic in ordinary times, were visited to-morrow by some calamity -- a siege, for instance -- that same selfish city would decide that the first needs to satisfy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 48</a><div class="page-content">"were those of the children and the aged. Without asking what services they had rendered, or were likely to render to society, it would first of all feed them. Then the combatants would be cared for, irrespective of the courage or the intelligence which"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">each had displayed, and thousands of men and women would outviee each other in unselfish devotion to the wounded.

This tendency exists, and is felt as soon as the most pressing needs of each are satisfied, and in proportion as the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">productive power of the race increases. It becomes an active force every time a great idea comes to oust the mean preoccupations of everyday life.

How can we doubt, then, that when the isntruments of production are</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">its sphere of action till it becomes the ruling principle of social life?

Following these indications, and considering further the practical side of expropriation, of which we shall speak in the following chapters, we are convinced that our first</div></div>
