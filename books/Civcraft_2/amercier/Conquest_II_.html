CHAPTER III.

ANARCHIST COMMUNISM</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 42</a><div class="page-content">II.

In taking "Anarchy" for our ideal of political organisation we are only giving expression to another marked tendency of human progress. Whenever European societies have developed up to a certain point, they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"have shaken off the yoke of authority and substituted a system founded more or less on the principles of individual liberty. And history shows us that these periods of partial or general revolution, when the old governments were overthrown, were also "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"periods of sudden progress, both in the economic and the intellectual field. So it was after the enfranchisemtn of the communes, whose monuments produced by the free labour of the guilds, havenever been surpassed; so it was after the great peasant"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 42</a><div class="page-content">uprising which brought about the Reformation and imperilled the papacy; and so it was again with the society, free for a brief space, which was created on the other side of the Atlantic by the malcontents from the Old world.

And, if we observe</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"the present development of civilized nations, we see, most unmistakably, a movement ever more and more marked tending to limit the sphere of action of the Government, and to allow more and more liberty to the individual. This evolution is going on"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 42</a><div class="page-content">before our eyes, though cumbered by the ruins and rubbish of old institutions and old superstitions. Like all evolutions, it only waits a revolution to overthrow the old obstacles which block the way, that it may find free scope in a regenerated society.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">    After having striven long in vain to solve the insoluble problem -- the problem of constructing a government "which will constrain the individual to obedience without itself ceasing to be the servent of society," men at last attempt to free</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"themselves from every form of government and to satisfy their need for organisation by free contacts between individuals and groups pursuing the same aim. The independence of each small territorial unit becomes a pressing need; mutual agreement replaces"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content">law in order to regulate individual interests in view of a common object -- very often disregarding the fonrtiers of the present States.

    All that was once looked on as a function of the Government is to-day</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"called in question. Things are arranged more easily and more satisfactorily without the intervention of the State. And in studying the progress made in this direction, we are led to conclude that the tendency of the human race is to reduce Government"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">interference to zero; in fact, to abolish the State, the personification of injustive, oppression, and monopoly.

     We can already catch glimpses of a world in which the bonds which bind the individual are no longer laws, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">social habits -- the result of the need felt by each one of us to seek the support, the co-operation, the sympathy of his neighbours.

     Assuredly the idea of a society without a State will give rise to at least as many objections as the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"political economy of a society without private capital. We have all been brought up from our childhood to regard the State as a sort of Providence; all our education, the Roman history we learned at school, the Byzantine code which we studied later under "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the name of Roman law, and the various sciences taught at the universities, accustom us to believe in Government and in the virtues of the State providential.

     To maintain this superstition whole systems of philosophy have been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">elaborated and taught; all politics are based on this principle; and each politician, whataever his colours, comes forward and says to the people, "Give my party the power; we can and we will free you from the miseries which press so heavily upon you."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"     From the cradle to the grave all our actions are guided by this principle. Open any book on sociology or jurisprudence, and you will find there the Government, its organisations, its acts, filling so large a place that we come to believe that there"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">is nothing outside the Government and the world of statesmen.

     The Press teaches us the same in every conceivable way. Whole columns are devoted to parliamentary debates and to political intrigues; while the vast everyday life of a nation appears</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"only in the columns given to economic subjects, or in the pages devoted to reports of police and law cases. And when you read the newspapers, you hardly think of the incalculable number of beings -- all humanity, so to say -- who grow up and die, who know"</div></div>

     And yet, as soon as we pass from</div></div>

     Another striking fact, which especially characterises our generation, speaks still more in favour of our ideas. It is the continual extension</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"of the field of enterprise due to private initiative, and the prodigious development of free organisations of all kinds.

<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"     This impotence is becoming so evident to all; the faults of parliamentarianism, and the inherent vices of the representative principle, are so self-evidenct, that the few thinkers who have made a critical study f them (J.S.
