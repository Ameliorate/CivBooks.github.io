The LSIF stands for the Libertarian Socialist International Federation. It is a loose cobbling of various communes within Civcraft characterized by shared productive</div></div>

Our first unofficial anthem is The Internationale;

We have no official flag, but two colours,</div></div>

We have many mottos, including: "God is dead - - now together let us build heaven!" And, "Every citizen a king; every</div></div>

Our gross population fluctuates with the activity of casual players, but the active membership current ranges between 20-30. We're looking to bring that number up to try and beat our old record of +/- 50.</div></div>

In short, Libertarian Socialism is the abolition of hierarchically arranged, authoritarian institutions that control the means of production, aka both the State and</div></div>

Some famous Libertarian Socialists:</div></div>

How do LSIF communes demonstrate Libertarian Socialism?</div></div>

The basic unit of the LSIF is the commune, all of which are voluntarily formed of free-associating individuals, politically and economically united for common prosperity.

How LSIF interacts with the rest of Civcraft

***

In General, LSIF communes are secret</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">and closed to the public by default, with some notable exceptions (The Goldmaune Commune in Columbia; The Ataraxia Commune in Mt. Augusta) that usually serve as embassies or jump-off points for new members.

LSIF has undertaken</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">a peacekeeping role in multiple conflicts, often sending troops to quell violence or disperse griefers if the activities threaten general order.

LSIF has remained strictly pacifist in accordance with the NAP since its inception, and does not condone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">or tolerate griefers, terrorists, or theives either within its ranks or without.

While within LSIF there is no currancy or formalised exchange, the LSIF Foreign Exchange (or ForEx) is a general brand for LSIF marketplaces that service the other</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">factions and individuals of Civcraft. In general, once a commune has produced a surplus of a good it cannot utilize, it will check other communes to see if they are in need, and if not, those surplues are sold at rock-bottom prices at the nearest ForEx.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Benefits of membership

A place to go, wherever you go.

LSIF communes are scattered all around, and we have embassies in most major cities, forming a comprehensive support network. As a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">member, you enjoy free travel between LSIF communes (many of which are otherwise closed to the public) and fast-tracked inter-commune membership applications.

Abundance and prosperity;</div></div>

Our communes are highly developed, so you can begin grinding, farming, or brewing right away without spending the time</div></div>

How to join.
***

Form a commune that demonstrates democratic decision-making and common ownership,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">communal storage, and mostly gift-based economy. We do accept some slight variations, including Mutualists, and are open minded towards new ideas.

Join an existing commune: Public communes allow you to interact with other factions and cities,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">while closed ones are private, but close-knit communities focused on production and construction.

In either case, seek out an LSIF member to get the ball rolling. Memberships for individuals with no criminal records usually can be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">approved within a day, and new commune additions within a week. If you have LSIF friends to vouch for you, that's all the better, otherwise you'll likely undergo a short provisional membership while you're shown the ropes and we get to know you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Some members to contact: straightfoolish, bodhidharma420, amercier, awearyworld, bobpndrgn, or just start yelling in local chat until someone directs you to a nearby commune.</div></div>
