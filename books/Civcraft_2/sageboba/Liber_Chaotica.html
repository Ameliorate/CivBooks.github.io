<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Foreword:
Hello reader, this book contains information about the dark gods and the correct ways to worship them. Although I am the writer of this book most of this information</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 32</a><div class="page-content">I have merely transcribed from ancient tomes for you dear reader!

Chapter One - An Introduction To Chaos:

Chaos, what is Chaos…? Chaos is inside of us all and we are all inside of it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Chaos is emotions and feelings made manifest. It only exists because we do.
The four dark gods represent these emotions and feelings.

Khorne - God of anger, hate and violence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Nurgle - God of death and decay.

Slaanesh - God of lust, greed, excess, pain, pleasure, perfection and hedonism.

Tzeentch - God of change, magic, mutation and destiny.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Each of these gods has their own demons associated with them, but I won’t go into that here. The most important thing you understand is the core concept of each of these individual gods.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Although one could argue that people should unite and fight against these forces, it is impossible to ever win, Chaos will exist forever. It is far more wise to join these forces, they shall offer you everything you desire!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Two - Converting To Chaos:

So, you want to convert to the dark gods. First of all, forgo any false religion you currently have and cast down your false idols. Then decide which of the Chaos gods you want to worship,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 32</a><div class="page-content">you can pick any or all of them. If you worship more than one then you belong to Chaos Undivided. If you have questions about Chaos and the dark gods and which to pick, you should seek out any nearby followers and talk to them.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 32</a><div class="page-content">
Chaos Undivided worship Chaos itself in one way or another.
But it’s totally your choice to decide. Just be careful if you decide to change, the dark gods can be very vengeful.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The next step is to find a place of worship nearby and unite with your fellow servants of Chaos. If one does not exist then you should seek to create one, and that leads onto our next chapter…</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Three - Worshipping Chaos

The Chaos gods each have their own ways you can serve them, Khorne for example appreciates unadulterated bloodshed and slavery, sometimes even killing other Chaos worshippers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 32</a><div class="page-content">As long as you follow the core principles of your chosen god(s) you will be fine.

You should also worship at a temple or a shrine, although not required it would be a meeting place for followers of the dark gods</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 32</a><div class="page-content">and encourage growth. If no such place of worship exists nearby then gather as many believers as you can and found one. It is your choice which of the Chaos gods it should celebrate. Simple shrines for a few believers are good, but if you seek to create a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 32</a><div class="page-content">large place of worship such as a temple, then you should adorn it with the symbols of your chosen gods, #MISSING FROM THE BOOK VERSION CHECK ONLINE#. But the one thing that is required no matter what, is that you include the following on a</div></div>

Although some states will allow you to believe in Chaos, it is likely that your beliefs will be at odds with the principles of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 32</a><div class="page-content"> your nation. If they let you, you’re free to stay there and spread the word of the dark gods. Although, if you worship Khorne I don’t think he’ll appreciate this cowardly peaceful behaviour, tis better to have the skulls of your enemies in your hand than</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 32</a><div class="page-content">their mind on your side.

To be a true follower of Chaos you must abandon your homes and join/create a warhost and spread the religion of the ruinous powers far and wide, let no nonbeliever survive.</div></div>

The weak will be killed by the strong, thus is the way of things. And as a follower of Chaos it is your duty to join a warhost should such a thing occur. But, should there be no ongoing warhost or the only warhosts are</div></div>

Gather any followers of chaos nearby and tell them to spread the word that you’re creating a warhost. It is a good idea to make sure you have a place to meet up, and launch</div></div>

Any political structure in your warhost is ultimately up to you, but trust me when I say, Chaos does not smile upon cowardly democratic activity.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 32</a><div class="page-content">The people that join your mighty legion should be without question of your leadership, there is no need for democracy when you’re all of one mind. The goal of a warhost is to kill nonbelievers, spread the word of Chaos, and to honour the dark gods.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 32</a><div class="page-content">And Khorne especially smiles on the bloodshed.

And if you’re wondering where I am personally, and if I’m involved in a warhost. Me and my close friends are building a Chaos fortress,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 32</a><div class="page-content">unfortunately I cannot yet reveal it’s location… but should the time come when we start a warhost rally under our banner and help us kill the pathetic people that don’t worship the dark gods!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 32</a><div class="page-content">Chapter Five - The Tenets Of Chaos:

1. No killing other worshippers of Chaos. (This rule is flexible to say the least…)

2. No stealing from other worshippers of Chaos.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 32</a><div class="page-content">3. No griefing other worshippers of Chaos.

4. No hoarding all the loot in a warhost, it should be given to the leader(s) of the warhost 

5.  Chaos comes before any other allegiances, such as other religions</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 32</a><div class="page-content">or nations. So if you do not side with the forces of Chaos in a fight but instead with any other people, you shall be branded a renegade and will be treated as such.</div></div>
