I know there's no honor among thieves, and there never was, but there used to be some pride, some skill, some basic creativity. It really makes those of us with a sense of</div></div>

Chuckizzle sneered, slamming down his flagon of greef violently on the rough-hewn table. "B'vek, what do you want us to say? You asks us 'What do you do when you see a guard?' and I says,</div></div>

"So much ambition, so little education," said Eltren with a sigh. "My dear friends, we aren't mugging some LSIF tourist fresh off the ferry. The</div></div>

"Why don't you explain specifically what you'd like us to do?" asked Tehaleks calmly, trying to keep the tone of the group down. Most locals at the Lux inn in Danzig knew enough not to listen in, but she knew better</div></div>

"The common thief," said Eltren, pouring himself more greef, warming to his subject. "Sticks his dagger in his opponent's back. This may slay the target, but more often gives him time to scream and drenches</div></div>

Now a good throat-slashing, properly executed, can both slay and silence a guard and leave the thief relatively bloodfree.

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 41</a><div class="page-content">running through the streets. Even in Danzig, that's likely to warrant suspicion.

"If you can catch your victim lying down asleep or resting, you are in an excellent position. You place one hand over the mouth with your thumb under the chin,</div></div>

There is a risk here of becoming blood stained if you don\u0027t move the head quickly enough. If you\u0027re unsure, strangle the victim"</div></div>

Simply put, you grab your victim\u0027s throat from behind and while throttling him, you batter his face against the opposite wall.

"The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation, is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three</div></div>

Chuckizzle laughed loudly, "Can I see a demonstration sometime?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 41</a><div class="page-content">"Very soon," said Eltren. "If Tehaleks has done her job."

Tehaleks brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy. The last several hours had been a whirlwind to all.</div></div>

When the sun set, Eltren, Tehaleks, and Chuckizzle  approached the Merchants Guildhouse  on the east end of town. Tehaleks used her cachous of stoneflower to mask their scent</div></div>

She also acted as lead scout, and Eltren was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.

Chuckizzle opened the vault in his unique and systematic method.</div></div>

He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds, the vault was open and the gold was in hand."</div></div>

"Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well." Eltren said as he poured</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 41</a><div class="page-content">the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. "We'll meet back at the Lux inn tomorrow morning and split up the bounty."

The group parted ways. The only</div></div>

Tehaleks threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f\u0027lah fortune-teller, and headed north."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 41</a><div class="page-content">Chuckizzle headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the citywatch. 

Now I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought Eltren as he sloshed through the labyrinthine tunnels of sludge. His saddled pig</div></div>

The sun was fully risen when _dbb_ reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Rothbard. He reigned in his saddled pig and filled</div></div>

He slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had been tight, but _dbb_ had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed was wonderfully</div></div>

_dbb_ woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes, he thought he could still hear Chuckizzle's</div></div>

The song returned, and _dbb_  heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of stoneflower filled his nose and he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could pierce the inside of the</div></div>
