The Jacks started off in Lazuli playing peacefully and subverting the town. Their members somewhat kept to themselves though withdrawing from events that the townsfolk did</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Their plan was to set off TnT and blow the whole senate up and destroy most of the roads in Lazuli. They decided they would do it when no one was online, to avoid the compromise of someone discovering them when they were planting all of the TnT charges.</div></div>

War was declared between the Pumpkin Jacks and Lazuli. Toshibi on the council did not want to fight, he had other plans. He alone talked to the Jacks and formed a cease fire with them. Toshibi</div></div>

The Lazulians raided that house and attacked the Jacks who were using the house's grinders without the owner's permission. The Lazulians assumed this house was one of the Jacks' strongholds. The Jack's fled this tower.</div></div>
