Do we exist in our cube filled world of drama and agony? Why are we here, if even we are? This book attempts to tear open these questions, and bring about new ideas on why we exist in whatever plane this is.</div></div>

Chapter 1- Planes beyond ours. "Why do we call these shapes cubes?"

Chapter 2- Do we serve a purpose? 

Chapter 3- Can we transcend our spatial boundaries?</div></div>

   Our world is built out of cubes. This we know, obviously. We have our basic elements, dirt, stone, wood, cobble, all cube shaped. What is a shape? The form a substance takes on in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 26</a><div class="page-content">our world. What "shapes" do we have? Rectangles, Cubes, Rectangular Prisms, Squares. Nothing more. It is simple. It is something we all know. But, are there potentially more shapes out there? Could, in fact, there be more objects, without</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 26</a><div class="page-content">angles? Take a look at the development of a tree. In its early stages, you can almost make out something modern physicists call a "curve". A rounded edge. Of course, this "curve" is made of smaller squares, but if a curve can appear in this form, why can</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 26</a><div class="page-content">it not appear in others? Using advanced calculations, scientists and mathematicians have developed models depicting something called a "sphere". An object that would be placeable, similar to a cube, with all round edges.</div></div>

This is a very rough drawing, but the general idea can be pieced together. If this can somehow exist in our world, why does</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 26</a><div class="page-content">it not? Ideas have been proposed, but the most recent and most popular is the idea of seperate planes. We exist on a plane that only allows the four main shapes to exist. Why this is,  we do not know. Other planes, unlike the Netherworld or the Endworld,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 26</a><div class="page-content">could allow such shapes to exist. The implications of this are yet unknown, but if other planes were to exist in this way it has the potential to affect us enormously. It may control how we eat, live, move. It may even be the reason for our existence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2


    Do we serve a purpose? We do exist. We do move. We build. We live on a three dimensional plane consisting of four main shapes. The idea described in the previous chapter is possible and it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 26</a><div class="page-content">may offer insight into this. If other planes do exist, built off of other shapes that cannot exist in our own, many other structures could be created there. These structures would be monstrously more complex than anything in our world, devised from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 26</a><div class="page-content">spheres, which may react differently than cubes do to movement. The implications of this would be huge, and could potentially allow one plane to create
another less complex plane, or "universe".
A world could exist within another plane, such</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 26</a><div class="page-content">as our own. Everything we know could exist inside a seperate plane.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3


   Can we transcend our spatial boundaries? What keeps "us" (who are we anyway? Are we simply blobs of energy?) from entering into another plane such as the one previously</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 26</a><div class="page-content">described? Is it that we are built from the four simple shapes? That would be unlikely, as they would be able to maintain existence in a more complex plane. What allows us to think then? Is that what holds us in this universe? Are our minds simply</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 26</a><div class="page-content">incapable of escape?
This would make more sense, but is also unlikely, as we have developed the idea of the sphere. So, if our minds are capable of creating complex objects, and going above the four simple shapes, and our bodies could exist in another</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 26</a><div class="page-content">reality, why are we here and not there? Why must we exist in a plane which limits the true possibilities of our minds? I believe the answer lies with the "ttk2", a mythological person some claim to be God.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 26</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4


Who is this ttk2 person? Some say he is God, the creator of our world. Some say he is nonexistant. Some say he's just nuts. 
Seperate planes gives the God idea some scientific merit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 26</a><div class="page-content">though, what if there IS a creator. He would be the most likely candidate. What if, in fact, we all exist outside of this plane? Or, at least, our minds do. What if this plane was created by this "ttk2" as a model for a society in a more complex plane?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 26</a><div class="page-content">This God Theory would make sense. A person outside of our world created it to simulate his own, and populated it with his own people, given new bodies to fit its structure. If this is indeed the case, our world is but a joke. A mockery of something even</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 26</a><div class="page-content">more complex. This is not fact, obviously, but with more evidence arriving it could become so. Beyond the LSIF, the HCF, Augusta, Aristopolis, Tigerstaden, the fallen city of Columbia, ttk2 may reign supreme over it all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 26</a><div class="page-content">




Our universe could very well be a test.</div></div>
