Anarchist officer structure is much different from conventional army hierarchy. All officers should be democratically elected by his or her soldiers, and should be fully recallable by his or her</div></div>

The soldiers under the command of the officer's position would elect one of their own comrades-in-arms to direct them, based on trust and merit. Likewise, upon breach of skill, trust , discipline or upon unnecessarily</div></div>

Here it must be said that hierarchy does exist in a sense. Officers take orders from their commanding officers, and give orders to their subordinates. However, although this is relevant for tactics during a</div></div>

Justice in an anarchist force is handled similarly. Disciplinary measures are voted on by the soldiers, and are, in the case of the Ukrainian</div></div>

Depending on the size of the army, relevant juries are made up of as many soldiers as possible. Consequently a trial is held, as normal, with the accuser and defendant.</div></div>

General Assemblies are also an important part of organisation and are important for deciding larger, more general issues and strategic decisions. This is where ALL members of the army gather to discuss and vote</div></div>

It is important also to note that anarchist armies are, in theory, completely voluntary. Soldiers may join and leave as they so wish, as the concept of desertion is not valid at all.

Minecraft Anarchist Tactics are usually centred around styles of guerilla and riot warfare. Retreating, counterattacking, and harassing continually are important</div></div>

Historically, many anarchist forces had to utilise cheap ways to perform warfare. Here we find the same relevance in Minecraft. It is better to fight defensively, with stone swords, petty armour and bows, and to spawn constantly, than</div></div>

It is important to invest in good, enchanted bows, so snipers can pick off attackers, who would be harassed by melee fighters armed with stone swords, and eventual splash potion throwers</div></div>
