<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Tropica is a small archipelago, comprised of 8 beach islands, 2 jungle islands, and 1 artificial island. It is located in the +,- quadrant, just on the border of the -,- quadrant.

Tropica was discovered on January 23, 2014 when I,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Des23, went searching for a place my friends and I could call home. I quickly set up camp by building a small base and a harbor. I could now call Tropica mine. My friends 1337person40idk (we call him Milkshake) and TheTownster joined me 2 days later.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">All of the Tropicans were together now. January 27th is the day we formally named the island chain Tropica. 

For a while, we lived off of watermelons from our small farm and food we took from abandoned homes (side note: it was wrong of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">us to loot any home since we only assumed they were abandoned. We were desperate and couldn't grow anything in the jungle. We don't loot anything anymore. It's bad, mmkay.) On February 24th, I went searching for a place where we could farm good crops like</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">wheat and carrots. I ended up finding a large, uninhabited forest that was perfect for large farms. The forest island became our Western Territory (we call it ABfFH. It's an inside joke). I set up farms and we soon had a surplus of food, making Tropica</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">more prosperous than it had ever been. 

Not only was the Western Territory good for farming, but it was also good for mining. In a matter of 2 days, we went from having 3 diamonds to 48 diamonds.

As we continue to mine</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">and farm, we get closer to our goal of modernization and opening up Tropica to the public.

On March 15th, disaster struck. For the first time in history, Tropica was griefed. A cabin I built was completely destroyed, chests</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">in two of our buildings were looted, and two of our pets/mascots were murdered. I could only blame myself for not being more careful and reinforcing my buildings. Our morale was destroyed. I honestly though about abandoning Tropica and moving to New</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Danzilona (a little dramatic, I admit). But then, on that same day, we were contacted by Shamrock Jones, King of Avalon. There was a small border dispute due to the fact that they built on the island just north of our Western Territory. Instead of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">arguing, he offered assimilation of Tropica into the Kingdom of Avalon. We Tropicans joyfully accepted. We hoped our unity would help bring Tropica back on its feet, and we hoped our land, people, and resources would help the Kingdom grow. On March 18th,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Tropica officially became a part of the great Kingdom of Avalon. 

That brings us to now. Since we joined the Kingdom, not much has changed, but to be fair, we haven't been very active since then. I hope that once all</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">the Tropicans are active again that we can all meet and start benefiting each other. I have some things to talk about at the next meeting where we could hopefully start this. 

Officially, Tropica has no government. But in reality, we kinda do.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Since we're all friends, we didn't want to have a government with different positions of power and all that stuff, but we still wanted to have rules so we would all be treated fairly. Our nation is based around the cooperation of the three of us, and we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 16</a><div class="page-content">have rules to make sure we can all benefit from our land and resources. We call this kind of government a "cooperative anarchy."

The Tropican economy is solely self-sufficient. We have done no trading with any other cities.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 16</a><div class="page-content">We gather building resources from the mainland and mine and farm in our Western Territory. Our main goal is to just stay alive, be able to protect each other, and have fun. 

I think that covers all of the major events and things about</div></div>
