Extending his hand he called out the ancient summoning words his father had told him so many years ago</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Be my nigga, Throngastoff, dancing Throndson of the moon.” the crescent blade materialized out of seemingly nothing, Renekton’s pure energy. All eyes were on Renection, and all lives were in Renection’s hands. Renekton said “Soraka, grant me one last</div></div>

Give me the strength to fight Archdemon Throndsiban, and temper my Throndson so that it may contend with the vast powers held within N-I-T’salamention-Bane, high blade of the Red Throndson.” Soraka nodded at Renection and uttered the words</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“For life” Soraka extended her hand and infused Renection with the power of the stars. Renection’s blade Throngastoff glowed with a brilliant yellow light, resembling that of the purest urine. Renection began to grow, his size rivaling even that of the</div></div>

Renection spoke loudly and confidently to the demon “This is my new world, and I’ll have none of your kind, nor the British, in it” Throndsiban retorted angrily “FOOOOL. You have no power over me!

Burger King©” He dashed forward, slicing at the thick fatty tissue of Throndsibar’s tummy. Throndsibar easily dodged the attack. Then, as if in slow motion, Renection watched as</div></div>

Renection let out a bloody scream. The townspeople shrieked in horror. Renection was forced to the ground from the impact of the blow, his severed scales flying off in an arc. Renection's eyes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 23</a><div class="page-content">were closed as the townspeople looked on in horror. Throndsibar then let out a maniacal laugh. He then taunted the people “Who else wants a taste of N-I-T’salamention-Bane, high blade of the Red Thron. Soraka yelled “I’ll take a piece baby, get out of my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 23</a><div class="page-content">kitchen." Throndsiban yelled in rage at the taunt of the young goat bitch and said “Prepare yourself, young goatwench. Your last domino falls here. So to speak.” He rose the blade above his head. As Soraka was bracing herself for the attack, preparing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">for her life to end. She heard Renection yell out “aaaand DICE.” Soraka opened here eyes to see Throndsibar’s right arm, the arm holding N-I-T’salamention-Bane, lying on the ground in a pool of demonic blood. Renection had sliced off Throndsibar’s arm,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 23</a><div class="page-content">bringing the Red Blade down upon his head, killing him in an instant. “Little did you know that if I hit an enemy with my slicing move, I can attack them again with a move called Dice which is basically the same thing! Hah!” Soraka said “Oh Renection, my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 23</a><div class="page-content">herrroooooooooooooo.” Renection looked at Soraka solemnly and said “Nigareh.” in an instant, Soraka’s heart dropped, the memories floating back to her. She remembered her betrayal of the star celestials, and of her being born of Red Throndson blood. The</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">scene before her changed from a hero and his kill to a brother and her father. The shock was too great and Soraka died. Seeing this, people jeered at Renection shouting “Crocodile! Alligator!” Renection bowed his head and said no words as the townspeople</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 23</a><div class="page-content">seized him, stripping him of his garments and placing upon his head a crown of thorns. They thrust upon him a large wooden cross, commanding him to carry it up a large hill, where he was to be crucified. Painstakingly slow and painfully, Renection carried</div></div>

Renection was lowered on the the cross, and nails were thrust into his hands and feet. He stood up and the pain was unbearable. He cried out,</div></div>

King of the Jews!” Nine hours passed and but few townsfolk remained on site. The pain was too great for Renection. He cried out "Father, unto you I command my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 23</a><div class="page-content">spirit!” And he died. A young boy, witnessing the scene, said quietly to himself, “Truly this man was the son of God.”

How could any company in their right mind sell him shoes that didn’t fit his feet. He angrily stormed into Walmart, the location at which the Crocs were purchased.
