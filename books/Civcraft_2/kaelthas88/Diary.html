<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">rules? How long before I get my chance? I saw Koentinius yesterday. He was in the plaza talking with Kawww. He was right there! So close I could have severed his spine in less than a heartbeat! Oh Mother, never before have I had to exercise such</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">self-control. What's sickeningly ironic is that it was Prussia's
discipline that allowed me to restrain myself. I've been part of their "family" for so long it's part of me, whether I like it or not. And in all that time I've fooled them all. They see me</div></div>

Some day soon i will learn the truth about _Dbb_, and when i do, i will use that trust to get close to him. Close enough so that I may rend the head from his body, just as Koentinius did to you so long ago!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Damn it, mother! why did it have to be this way? Gezoerksel was so beautiful. She was so perfect in so may ways. Why couldn't she handle the truth? Why couldn't she realize her "family" didn't really love her? She was a murderer like the rest of us. Paid</div></div>

I really thought we could be together. make a real family, with real love. But she told me she could never accept your place in my life. So now she's gone. She didn't deserve to live after the horrible things she said about</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">you. I never should have told her, I know. I'm so sorry. It will never happen again, and the others will never find her, don't worry. There's nothing left of her to find.</div></div>
