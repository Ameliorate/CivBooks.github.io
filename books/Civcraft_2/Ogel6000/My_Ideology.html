          of my
   Political Ideology






by Ogel6000</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 27</a><div class="page-content">The first thing one should know about my political beliefs, is that I do not have a single ideology which I follow everywhere. 

A political ideology is an idea. It is one point of view. One way of looking at things. One side of a debate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 27</a><div class="page-content">It is just that: A side.

Regimes are not one dimensional. They are not composed of only one side. Regimes are shapes. They are composed of many sides, all fitting together smoothly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 27</a><div class="page-content">My political beliefs differ regime to regime. I adjust what I believe is right based on what individual problems each regime faces. For every country, I have a different political belief.

I do, however, have three absolutes:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">1. I do not like corporations, at least the way they exist now. I don't care what you say, but they have problems, generally. Tbh, If Canada and USA weren't both dominated by TeleCom Oligopolies, I would feel a lot better. If electronics companies could</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 27</a><div class="page-content">make quality products at a affordable costs, I would feel better. If you could tell me an oil company that doesn't disobey safety standards on a daily basis, I would feel better.

Until then, sorry.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 27</a><div class="page-content">2. I believe that all humans are entitled to a comfortable standard of living as long as they positively contribute to society. This includes, but is not limited to, enough wage to feed, clothe, house, and entertain each person. Things like healthcare are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 27</a><div class="page-content">rights, not priviliges. All human beings are entitled to be able to have a healthy life, and should not be hindered due to financial problems.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 27</a><div class="page-content">3. Scientific and technological growth may not be hindered under any circumstance. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Radical theists preaching against science

- Conservatives</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 27</a><div class="page-content">holding a belief similar to "Science is only worthwhile if it provides commercial benefit". 

- Corporations such as Apple who have claimed to "Stop innovating" immediately after the death of Steve Jobs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Now that these three absolutes are known, I will elaborate my opinion on various already developed political ideologies:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Marxism: I am interested in the idea of a Marxist revolution, and I believe that many countries are overdue for one. However, I am unconfident as to the long term effects of a Marxist revolution: a collapse into oppressive dictatorship seems</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 27</a><div class="page-content">imminent to me here.

Leninism: I am an enormous fan of Vladimir Lenin, the Russian Communist revolutionary and premier. I think Leninism, or a slightly altered version of his attempt at collectivisation may do better than expected.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Liberalism/Centralism (statist): I'm going to be honest here, I like having a state. I realise the arguments against it, and I acknowledge the comparisons between state and corporation, but that doesn't turn me off. There's something different about the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 27</a><div class="page-content">state. Also, I am quite a fan of Justin Trudeau, the Liberal Party leader in Canada, and I do vote Liberal. 

I am also a fan of other Centralist leaders, such as Julia Gillard, and Helle Thorning-Schmidt.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Fascism (not naziism):
People are generally stupid and weak minded, and often do not possess the ability to make intelligent and moral judgments for themselves. A fascist regime, if a pure-of-heart leader is selected, could lead to many large advancements</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 27</a><div class="page-content">both socially, scientifically, and otherwise. The problem with fascism, as seen in the past, is bad judgment selecting leaders.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 27</a><div class="page-content">AnCapism: I have done quite a lot of reading about Anarcho-Capitalism, and to be honest, I do have some respect for the ideology, despite no supporting its implementation in society. It has been neat watching AnCap cities rise and fall in Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 27</a><div class="page-content">AnCom: Anarcho-Communism, a system where people willingly contribute to a public collective. It would be the ideology of a utopic world: Everyone is equal, everyone has access, and people can work at their own rate, doing what they want.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 27</a><div class="page-content">This cannot work in the real world, because the average morality of humankind is too low. 

AnCom has worked in Civcraft, because within the game world, there is more motivation to work collaboratively, and help others.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Democracy: A quote I admire is "The best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter". It is so very true. Nobody votes in the best interest of their country anymore. People only vote for who their parents voted for,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 27</a><div class="page-content">or if a certain candidate promises to make the individual richer. Democracy is on the verge of failure in Canada and USA, among others.

Again, the average societal IQ. If it was higher, democracy would work better.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Socialism: Socialism is probably a good word to associate with me. Unlike some people, I do not believe Socialism and Communism are the same thing. For those who do not differentiate, here is my personal definition: Socialism is Capitalism with heavy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 27</a><div class="page-content">socialisation of infrastructure, such as telecom, healthcare, insurance, and so on, as well as restrictions on corporations to promote wellbeing of the working class, such as large minimum wage.

It can be described as extreme Liberalism, I guess.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 27</a><div class="page-content">This is a view I revere, and would choose to apply to many states.

It has proven to be the primary ideology of many societies on Civcraft, such as Aurora and Orion; which despite claiming to be Capitalist, featured public communal factories,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 27</a><div class="page-content">and large tracts of communal farmland.

It is the ideology that I would apply to most states in the real world, as well. Despite my belief that a successful Anarcho Communist regime would be the closest to a utopia, mankind does not have the morality</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 27</a><div class="page-content">to enforce such a regime, thus Statist Socialism, in my eyes, is the most preferable regime for most places in the real world, and many in Civcraft.</div></div>
