<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 34</a><div class="page-content">    Copyright is the very antithesis to human advancement. Copyright is the idea that you can restrict the spreading and sharing of human knowledge and intellect. It is the idea that you must pay money simply to be allowed to possess or share a thought.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content">It is a horrible reflection of what Capitalism truly is.

I do not believe in copyright law. I do not believe any human being possesses the moral right to restrict others from sharing ideas. Even if you are the creator of the idea. Because, from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">the moment you write your thought down on paper, speak it to your friend, or transfer it from your mind to the real world in any way, you are consenting for this thought to be made public and shared with humanity. You cannot simply express a thought, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 34</a><div class="page-content">then restrict people from gaining it.

I do, however, believe that people should be credited with their ideas. There is no way to force people to cite quotations, or acknowledge the original creator of the thought, it is simply a voluntarist action</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 34</a><div class="page-content">which should be done. The creator of the thoguht does not ahve the right to profit from sharing this thought, he does have the right to be acknowledged as the creator of that thought.

But why? Because humans are greedy, and ultimately</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 34</a><div class="page-content">more interested in self gain that societal gain. Thus by crediting thoughts to their creator, we encourage the creator to keep coming up with thoughts that could benefit society.

Piracy is the free sharing of knowledge, it's the ability to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content">openly discuss, watch, listen to, play, enjoy, collaborate whatever thoughts, inventions, games, music, movies, intellect, which exists. Why does Hollywood make movies? So that people watch them. if a creator restricts people from gaining their thought,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">they have committed hypocrisy: they have published their thoughts, but then gotten angry when people attempted to openly share the thought.

And yes, I have openly, fervently stated that all creators, especially</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Hollywood, create movies for the purpose of people watching them. I realise what I have said, and using the term 'Capitalism' as an excuse does not justify being 'for profit'.

What does 'for profit' mean in this context?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">It means that you think you have the right to only share your ideas and knowledge with those willing to pay to access them. If you claim that you are for profit, you claim that your own financial wellbeing is more important than the growth and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">intellectual wellbeing of society.

Anyone who possesses this belief is not morally sufficient.

I realise that I am suggesting Libertarian Socialism.

I fully recognise that such an ideology will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">not work within our current regime. I doubt there is one country in the world that could undergo a Libertarian Socialist revolution, and excel at the ideology. The reason behind this is simply. Humans have misevolved. Eurocentric humans, which includes</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Europeans, or human beings affected by a European ideology have become, for whatever reason, more greedy than good.

I believe it is possible to execute a Libertarian Socialist regime in the modern world. I believe such a system should begin</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">almost as a private club or faction, which occupies land in, and inhabits, an existing country. However, there are a few requirements such a regime must meet to work functionally.

Such a regime must allow access into the collective</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">discriminately. People must first be observed in a Capitalist society to see how they act. What job they have, their free time, and must be judged as to whether or not they possess the moral standards to enter the system.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Since a Libertarian Socialist regime should not have leadership, anyone allowed into the regime must also possess the moral integrity to only judge and invite people who will not only perpetuate the moral integrity of the regime, but also in future</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">initations.

Such a regime has many strong benefits over a currently existing Capitalist system.

As one example, science will be created voluntarily, and openly, and for the purpose of pure</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">science and knowledge, unlike Capitalist society where there is an ever present need for profit and financial payoff, even to the point where Conservative politicians have openly stated that 'science is only worthwhile if it provides economic gain'.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Well, then it's not science, and does not serve the same purpose as science. Science exists to improve mankind's knowledge about the outside world, the universe, sub atomic particles, and so on. if it is only for financial gain, then it will only ever</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">improve mankind's knowledge about itself.

Voluntary science does not work within Capitalism, because in Capitalism, money is needed to survive. Money is a despicable invention by Capitalism, and holds no purpose but to trap people</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">within the ideology, both physically and mentally.

Money can be described as a tool used to standardise trade.

What is trade? Trade is the exchange of goods for other goods. The belief</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">that you should not give things to other people unless they are going to give something back. The idea of trade itself, is nothing more than the bourgeoisie corporate leaders at the top of society trying to cement their power by subconsciously putting the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">ideas of greed so deep in our genetic code that we don't even realise that it's there.

Trade is the teaching of greed. Money is the pink ribbon that ties it all together, glorifying it even more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Capitalism is built off of greed. Capitalism has huilt it self off of, and now sits firmly on a solid background of necessitating greed for survival within the ideology.

Voluntary anything is not possible in Capitalism, because Capitalism</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">has made it that way.

In Capitalism, there is no guilt for not contributing. If you choose not to work becaue you have enough money not to, you are riding on society without giving anything back. Capitalism has taught us that as long as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">you have the money to afford such a thing, you deserve to. In Libertarian Socialism, there's the guilt of knowing that you're not pulling your weight. And if the guilt is not enough to get you to work, then you do not deserve to be in such a system.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">The government has attempted to standardise and enforce a mandatory system of donations to the wellbeing of society. This is called 'taxation'. Unless you live in a corrupt system such as a kleptocracy, taxation is not theft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Because the money is not being taken away from society. It is simply being mixed around in society, whether they be into roads, buildings, healthcare, education, or welfare. it's not being stolen. it's still there, in society.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content"></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Stolen from YOU, you say?

People who claim that 'taxation is theft' are phenomenally arrogant to believe that their wellbeing is more important than the wellbeing of others. because if you believe that taxations is theft, you believe</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 34</a><div class="page-content">that you are above society, and that you actually deserve to be entitled to excess resources.

If you think taxation is theft, realise this: You're only in a system that reslies on taxation because you're too selfish to be willing to donate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 34</a><div class="page-content">your excess earnings back to society on your own. Thus the state needs to nanny you, and do it for you.

If people had enough concern, and were able to donate for themselves, taxation would not exist. Thus is you think taxation is stealing from you,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 34</a><div class="page-content">realise that taxation exists because you're stealing form society by not donating sufficiently.</div></div>
