<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 48</a><div class="page-content">I joined Civcraft the day of the map reset. I did play on the server a few hours before the reset, however, and in this time visited Rift, Constantinople, 0,0, and a couple of others which I am unable to name.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 48</a><div class="page-content">When 2.0 was launched, I was lucky enough to make it online for day 1. I spent the next few days wandering around without settling. I visited Commonwealth the day it was founded, along with very early Holy Tree. I probably visited others as well, though</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 48</a><div class="page-content">I do not remember exactly which.

I joined the True Neutral City, or the collective camp of Aurora, Fellowship, and Bryn while the three were seeking locations to settle. I was among the first to build a house in Aurora. Maybe the third.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Within the first several days of inhabiting Aurora, my house was griefed several times, each time by a different griefer; this was not abnormal at the time, most of the street suffered the same fate.

I traveled frequently to other cities. I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 48</a><div class="page-content">watched the growth of Fellowship, Bryn, Holy Tree, and the fall of some as well, such as Kappi, and Peppinopolis.

I started a shop in Aurora within a few days of arriving there. I sold mundane things, such as cobblestone, sand, and dirt. I tried to sell</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 48</a><div class="page-content">other things as well. My store hit its main growth when I began selling XP potions. Due to the painfully dull harvesting of stack after stack of wheat, I tired of XP production before too long. I tried to remain in stock, and did this by venturing to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 48</a><div class="page-content">other cities and buying XP at cheaper prices elsewhere. This was before even roads had been built; thus international travel was almost unheard of. 
Sometimes within or between foreign cities, I would spend large amounts of time wandering around</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 48</a><div class="page-content">markets, observing prices. Perhaps looking for a way to make profit. It worked on numerous occasions; buying from somewhere, walking down the street, sellit for a profit elsewhere.

However, as international roads began to appear, XP</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 48</a><div class="page-content">prices around the world began to calibrate from one to the other.

While still keeping my store going, one way or another, I decided to join Aurora to Kappi via road. This was during the peak of Kappi's life. Immediately after I began</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 48</a><div class="page-content">construction, I was informed that Kappi was dead; I continued with the road, hoping Kappi could be used as a hub. Instead of making a straight line, I decided to make th road loop far south, into the ++, hoping for future connections. This turned out to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 48</a><div class="page-content">be the case; as the road was soon connected with Holy Tree, and then later, Petrania. 

After finishing the Aurora-Kappi highway, I turned back to Aurora. With the expansion of several other small towns in the +-, around</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Aurora, I placed the Agoran flag down on an unmarked island between two seperate countries and Aurora. The federal government soon recognised Bohr Island as a province of the Agoran Federation. I named it Bohr Island, and began building there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Bohr Island never really took off. A few plots were sold, and houses built, but the residents soon went inactive, and I gave up. 
While working at Bohr, I was greeted by Freyr to the south, who were interested in selling XP in bulk. We eventually opened</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 48</a><div class="page-content">up permanent trade; I bought XP in bulk from them, then sold it in Aurora. I got about 1d a day profit. 

Around this time, I also began getting an interest in the Aurora State University, led by Orikebise. I built the observatory, and law building in the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 48</a><div class="page-content">university before Orikebise left during the Aurora/Agora split.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 48</a><div class="page-content">I ran in the federal election for the position of Secretary of Education, in charge of the university. This was the term during the infamous Brynnian election fraud, between Pantostado1066 and FriedrichHayek for Chancellor. I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 48</a><div class="page-content">won the election. I constructed an engineering building, owl statue, Law/Government building, and fancy promenade in the university during this time.

Also during this term was the rise of AnCap power in Aurora.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 48</a><div class="page-content">FriedrichHayek was pushing hard for a new constitution. He, alongside PeppermintPig, rewrote a constitution draft. I offered heavy criticism, pointing out the absurd amounts of ambiguity. After only minor revisions, it was put to the Federal Council for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 48</a><div class="page-content">vote. If 3/5 Council members voted in favour of a change, it happened. When the vote was put up, I immediately voted 'nay', while most of the rest of the government voted 'aye'. Upon inquiring, it turned out most others voted in favour of it without</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 48</a><div class="page-content">having even read it, claiming they were simply desperate for change. A few hours before the vote closed, Dr_Oracle (Secretary of State at the time) changed his vote to 'nay', claiming he read through it.

Nonetheless, the new constitution passed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 48</a><div class="page-content">3-2. The new constitution removed the Federal Council, replacing it with two magistrates who moderated the actions of the Chancellor.

Districts of Aurora were governed by Superintendents, chosen by the Chancellor. Being the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 48</a><div class="page-content">only person interested in the job, I was chosen as Superintendent of the university.

Around this time, I also tried to get the university up and running. I advertised to hire professors for different areas. Unfortunately, I only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 48</a><div class="page-content">received a few offers, none of which followed through with the creation of course materials. After this, I sort of gave up on the university once and for all. I maintained it a dream to one day get it functioning, but did not have the motivation to do so</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 48</a><div class="page-content">at the time. 

Also around this time, though I can't remember exactly when, Farley50 wrote an Auroran Charter, which was supposed to apply just to the city of Aurora, and fill in the gaps left by the constitution.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 48</a><div class="page-content">To make matters worse, the charter left just as many holes and ambiguities, accomplishing nothing much.

During FriedrichHayek's term as Chancellor, it became evident that the federal government was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 48</a><div class="page-content">deteriorating quickly in terms of support and power. It became a puppet, giving the illusion of governance, while providing no authority over Aurora at all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">After giving up on the university, I decided to ease up on politics for a while. I focused on my store, as well as tourism and visiting other countries.

I traveled almost daily, multiple times a week at the least, and offered myself no limitations as to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 48</a><div class="page-content">how far I went. I visited almost every city during this time. This was prior to the CIC reaching Aurora, so I found myself using my highway on regular occasion.

I also focused on my store. I had done my best throughout this time to keep my store</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 48</a><div class="page-content">stocked with XP constantly, though I had many lapses, and oftentimes I was pulling hairs to get enough in stock.

Commerce in Aurora never really took off in the first place. Few stores lasted long or were well known. "Ogel's General</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Store" was the longest running, and arguably most reliable store in Aurora. It was next jm13853211's "The Nether Portal", though this store was not usually in stock.

As such, I felt almost an obligation to keep my store functioning and stocked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 48</a><div class="page-content">reliably. When taargus' cooperative began dominating the Auroran XP trade, I began to realise that I needed to reform my store and its functionality.

I began selling potions in my store, as well as potion ingredients. Both were good sellers. I both</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 48</a><div class="page-content">bought and collected potion materials myself, traveling long distances never bothered me.

Thought it made my store profitable, I decided to further expand.

I also began selling enchanted armour,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 48</a><div class="page-content">weapons, and tools. I started with just U3E4 and U3E5 pickaxes, S4 and S5 swords, and anything else valuable that I managed to enchant.

This was during a small decline in Aurora's activity. According to the CAI, we were still second, and would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 48</a><div class="page-content">hold that position for another month, however Aurora felt deserted, with many houses noticeably derelicted. I took (or tried to take) an actively role in revitalising Aurora, including demolishing derelicted plots, building new roads, and so forth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 48</a><div class="page-content">This was during Taargus' term as Chancellor. Little happened during this term. The federal government continude to deteriorate in influence and authority.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 48</a><div class="page-content">I ran as Chancellor in October. I had the goal of writing another constitution, charter, and trying to revitalise the federal government. 

I won the election ahead of Juz16. Shadowjay1 received a couple of votes during this election,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 48</a><div class="page-content">though was not a noteworthy candidate in the race.

The two Magistrates elected were Hummelwagen and Dr_Oracle, both noteworthy Anarcho Capitalists during this time. 

According to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 48</a><div class="page-content">constitution, the Chancellor could be kicked out with unanimous support by the Magistrates. Dr_Oracle attempted to impeach me almost immediately after the election, though Hummelwagen disagreed.

My first major action</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 48</a><div class="page-content">as Chancellor was to put forward a few small bills, to organise the elections a bit better; one passed.

I also tried to kickstart commerce in Aurora; there were few functioning stores, and trade was uncommon. I, alongside some others, built</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 48</a><div class="page-content">many new shopspaces around Aurora's bay area, they were claimed too slowly.

Apart from these two minor events, my term is probably best known for my dissolution of the federal government, converting Aurora to a city-state.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 48</a><div class="page-content">This was motivated for a whole combination of different reasons, and I'm not too sure I understand it all myself. 

According to the constitution, the Chancellor had the power to claim or reject any land for the Federation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 48</a><div class="page-content">himself. Since Aurora was the only province at the time, by expelling Aurora, the federal government imploded.

The evening before I carried through dissolution, a long, somewhat frustrating, conversation was carried out in Mumble.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Though intelligent discussion was present at times, much of it was tense.

I addition to this, I recognised the AnCaps in Aurora as, by that point, overpowering the statists (such as myself).

I also understood</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 48</a><div class="page-content">that the federal government was, at that point, completely powerless beyond repair. A combination of these reasons was the main inspiration for me to dissolve the federal government.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 48</a><div class="page-content">During the blood raids that took place, my store was robbed on valuable items. Two Sharp IV diamond swords and Diamond Leggings Protection IV were stolen.

On top of this, I felt huge tenseness in the air in Aurora. It was painful, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 48</a><div class="page-content">unenjoyable for me. I hung around for a short time more, before leaving to start my own project, Saraliana.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 48</a><div class="page-content">Look out for Ogel's Autobio 1.5, where I add in some things which I could not fit in the 50 page book limit, such as Uk Tersk Staksa, my cult, the Auroran Popular Front, and more information on the Blood Raids.</div></div>
