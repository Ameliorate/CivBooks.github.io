One thing I don't know why
   It doesn't even matter
        how hard you try.
        Keep that in mind,
     I designed this rhyme
     to explain in due time.
             (All I know)
  Time is a valuable thing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">     Watch it fly by as the
         pendulum swings.
      Watch it count down
      to the end of the day.
 The clock ticks life away
           (It’s so unreal)
     Didn’t look out below
       Watch the time go
      right out the window</div></div>

      but didn’t even know
           I wasted it all
      just to watch you go

   I kept everything inside
   and even though I tried,
           it all fell apart</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">     What it meant to be
       will eventually be
 a memory of a time when

          I tried so hard
          And got so far

    It doesn't even matter</div></div>

    I designed this rhyme
    To remind myself how

     you were mocking me

     part of your property</div></div>

 times you fought with me
 I’m surprised it got so far
    Things aren’t the way
        they were before
       You wouldn’t even
   recognize me anymore
       Not that you knew
           me back then</div></div>

              In the end
     You kept everything
    inside and even though
     I tried, it all fell apart
      What it meant to me
        will eventually be
 a memory of a time when</div></div>
