   On the 5th of May, 2012, the Pumpkin Jacks along with a group of hired mercenaries known as Second Cell attacked Lazuli, pearling many of the citizens including the head of state at the time,</div></div>

   The war was over, Lazuli was defeated. Nate almost left the city at that point, but no doubt he was now attached to his first real home in Civcraft. Out of the fires of war, Nate was now an established and respected Lazulian.</div></div>
