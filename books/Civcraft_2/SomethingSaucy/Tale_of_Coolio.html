</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   The young lad, Coolio, spawned from the mud of Civcraft during its first era. Born from a peasant woman named Foofed, his father was always rumored to be the God of Civcraft, Ttk2. The resemblance was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 38</a><div class="page-content">uncanny. He was bored with life and decided to go to the Rift to make some friends to add to his clubhouse. When there, he met Matticus_Rex, a strapping young man who Coolio found strangely alluring. Coolio thought it best to introduce himself eloquently</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 38</a><div class="page-content">so he said "hai."
Matticus ignored him.
   So distraught with Matticus' refusal to be friends, Coolio retreated into the nearby woods where he found a group of people, which included Joshua and MinecraftisFTW. Coolio boasted furiously about how many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 38</a><div class="page-content">friends he had back in Rift. 
"Where is this?"
Coolio told them.
"You know we're gonna go destroy it now, right?" Josh said.
To which Coolio retorted, 
"<span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span>I don't care, I'm too coolio for you<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"</div></div>

   </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Coolio wandered onto a nearby beach where he saw a man building a house with his dog. 
"Hello! My name is Saucy and this is my dog, Sir Barks!"
"Hai," Coolio responded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 38</a><div class="page-content">"Would you like to join my new town? It's called Lazuli," Saucy said.
Coolio stared into space.
"Anyway, think you could help with Saucy Manor? I need you to take this flint and steel and make a campfire nearby," Saucy asked. Coolio</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 38</a><div class="page-content">and proceeded to light Saucy's house on fire, not out of malice, but pure confusement. Sir Barks bravely rushed into the fire to save Coolio, but dying in the process.
"Sir Barks, no!" Saucy cried.

   </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Tired and hungry, Coolio wandered into a fledgling city known as Mount Augusta, where he met two individuals known as mitchellspakes and Sami_Ghani. Coolio ate their cake shop, but Sami forgave him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 38</a><div class="page-content">anyway, because Sami was that kind of guy. Coolio thought this was a pretty sweet place and invited his friend, foxmcleod to come and stay. He then killed everyone and destroyed much of the city.

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   Coolio headed back to Lazuli to visit the grave of Sir Barks, when he happened on a group of folks wearing pumpkins on their heads. 
"Hi, I'm Noxy and this is my gang of dasterdly fellows! Care to join</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 38</a><div class="page-content"> in our attack on Lazuli?"
Coolio thought for a while before becoming distracted by his nose.
"Don't want to? It'll be fun!"

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   Coolio wandered in the jungles outside Columbia when he happened upon a fellow named Gatzy. 
"Hello, good sir! I'm just taking in the sights before going to sell my goods in the beautiful city of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Columbia!" Gatzy was a very astute and impressive individual
"nah, #blazeit coolpvp lol get rekt fuck foofed"

   </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Columbia was bustling with life as the new elections were going on, as Coolio strode through the streets. Coolio saw his mother, Foofed.
"Hey mom" he said
"Who the fuck are you?" Foofed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 38</a><div class="page-content">responded.
Heartbroken, Coolio left to stuff the balot boxes, calling for Columbia's dissolution. He then blamed it on Foofed. No one knows how he masterminded it.
"Coolio, you destroyed our government!"

   </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Coolio heard tales of a paradise for stupid people, Leningrad. So he headed there. Once there he met comhaioneach.
"You're fascinating, Coolio. I'll write a book on you one day," com</div></div>

"No you won't none of this is real," Coolio said as he stared into space.
Nearby, Zombie_Lenin and DiamondReaper were busy campaigning for who was going to become chief communist of their tribe. Or whatever. It looked like</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 38</a><div class="page-content">gaining in popularity, but Zombie_Lenin had an ace in his sleeve.
"Comrade Coolio! I need you to stuff the balot box for me. I'll reward you with empty promises and a spot on my newspaper staff!"
Sounded good to Coolio. He had always wanted to write</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 38</a><div class="page-content">propaganda. He would probably have to figure out what that word meant first though.
"Coolio, you caused DiamondReaper and his followers to leave and now our city is unstable!"

Coolio's dream of an empire would have to wait until much later when he would found Rothbard as an authoritarian, strong central state nation.
"So yeah please leave"

"Many of you expect me to send Civcraft into a new era," Ttk2 began. "But it is not as you think. I've decided to make my son the new God of Civcraft. His name is Coolio. He is now your god, you plebs." Ttk2 laughed as he</div></div>
