<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">We don't know where we started or why we existed. We didn't really question it. We just kind of survived. We didn't have any history at all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Every day we just felt like we started from nowhere. Some kind of god just created us as is. No advances. No cares. We just wanted to farm and trade our goods. We would buy goods and sell them back at a premium, but that was typical from any merchant.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Then as soon as we were created, a man arrived. Strange looking, kind of beaten, and rather poor. He would farm our crops, but we didn't mind. He always replanted them. We would pay him for his farming, and at the end of the day he left.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">We felt like we went into complete blackness and got reawakened in the morning when he came back.
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span> </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
He brought a lot of stones. He was very odd, carrying them in piles. Sixty-four stones a pile.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">He then built a massive wall with an iron door around our village. We couldn't get out because he put the button too high for us to reach. We didn't mind. He moved in with us, and he made sure it was always bright in our little village.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It was a great day when he erected a statue of one of us in the middle of town. Made completely of iron, emerald, and diamond. Like a totem to our existence. He worshiped us as gods.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It was quite amazing
- him living with us, protecting us, and worshiping us. Like a dream come true.
Until the day of reckoning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">He put us all in carts and destroyed our houses. He built a machine with two buttons. One that would keep us alive and the other that sent us to our deaths. We didn't expect it at first until we heard the screams.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">He let many of us live, and then someone didn't offer him a good enough deal. He wanted our deals. We bred and bred, teaching our kids about perfect deals and which ones pleased our god.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">My son knows many more things than I and offers much better deals than I could let myself offer. So today is the day. He will review my son and then me. I can only pray my son does well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Here he comes.
This is it.
He pressed the button. My son lives!
I love you son.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">It's my turn. Here we go. He pressed the button of death. The final click. The button that will remove me from existence, and my only legacy is my son. I hope he does well and raises children as fine as him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Goodbye son.
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span> </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Goodbye my poor enslaved village.
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span> </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
This is it.
<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span> </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
My life... stops here.</div></div>
