It was a dark and stormy night at the Fellowship Hexagon. The canals were overflowing with the rain, threatening to put out the netherrack lighting.

Bellix was a newcomer to Fellowship and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">was busily exploring the landscape, including the massive Hexgaon.

He stopped suddenly when he heard a loud moaning sound from deep in the canal toward the ocean.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">"It must be a Zombie that spawned!", he thought to himself, and went down the canal to smack it with his golden sword.

But when he got there, there was no Zombie, only the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">loud, low moaning of one. Bellix searched and searched, but could find no sign of the shambling undead.

Just then, lightning thundered all around, and all of the lights around the canal and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 10</a><div class="page-content">within the Hexagon went out at once. Not a sound could be heard except for the falling rain.

Bellix whirled around and exited the canal to the main part of the Hex. His only source of light was the constant</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 10</a><div class="page-content">flashing of lightning from above.

Suddenly, a loud hiss came from above, startling Bellix. But there was no Creeper. And no explosion.

Bellix shivered unnaturally, now</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">disturbed by the creepy surroundings.

He fumbled about in the darkness, attempting to find either the rail station or the exit of the Hex, but things just got darker and darker as he moved.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Once again, the same moaning sound started, and a hand brushed against Bellix in the dark.

He let out a scream but was quieted suddenly by a hand over his mouth.

Bellix struggled backwards, before</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 10</a><div class="page-content">falling into what he thought was the middle of the Hexagon. However, he continued to fall, and fall and fall endlessly.

Some say Bellix is still falling to this day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 10</a><div class="page-content">Was the Hexagon haunted?

Will the lights ever go out again?

Be careful, when you explore at night, you never know what will find you in the dark!</div></div>
