<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>HanTzu was grumpy. This had been his default mood for quite a while due to the siege on Titan, and the defeat at Playpen was not helping.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Which way?"<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Over by the northeast corner, in that little walled off</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He'd rather be playing League but what harm could it do? His prot, Last Rites, would protect him. Not that there was anything to worry about.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I built it myself."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was a catapult. A beautiful medieval</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">catapult. If HanTzu had ever played Age of Empires II or studied medieval history he would have identified it as an onager.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Nearby a horse in gold armor made noises in its pen. Where had he gotten the horse, Han wondered? And the bastions under his</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Matthew1034 climbed up the catapult and said "Aim for the water! It is fun!" as he climbed into the minecart teleporter and disappeared. Did he have a bunker up there? HanTzu followed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Just as he did, he saw Matthew1034 crash into a puddle next to the catapult with practiced ease. It was too late though. He was already hitting shift.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Suddenly he was very high up in the air and rotated to face north, and very scared. There was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">nothing under him. He was falling. Crap. Crap.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He didn't even see the water he was supposed to aim at until he hit ground. Dead. Crap.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And randomspawned. He hadn't set a bed. Crap. Crap.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"wtf Matthew wtf"</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I'm gonna get pearled man. People don't understand my cause and the need to protect our right to show people pictures of cat penises or whatever this war is about. They will kill me."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But he didn't die. HanTzu ran to Nox and then returned to his city of Titan via a secret tunnel. This took an hour.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When he got there he was exhausted. He was tired of being afraid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">of being pearled all the time. Tired of this stupid war.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Matthew1034 had waited with the patience of a saint with his prot. At least there was this guy, holding onto his prot for him, building cool but kind of dangerous things.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">But then he saw the sword, and in a flash he was pearled and Matthew1034 was wearing his prot, Last Rites, and galloping off over the walls and down the trenches on his stolen horse carrying the pearl of the person he'd spent a month befriending.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
