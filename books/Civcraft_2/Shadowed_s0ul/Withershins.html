<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Zaki put down his mug of mead and just stared at his wife for a few seconds. Finally, grudgingly: "Because every time I have a conversation, darling, it flows in alphabetical order.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Couldn't you just be imagining this?" said Kazagha patiently. "It wouldn't be the first time you had an insane paranoid delusion. Remember when you thought the royal battlemage</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Damn it, Kazagha!" snarled Zaki and stomped out, slamming the door behind him. He nearly collided with Siyasat, his neighbor."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Excuse Me" she said to Zaki's back. He clamped his hands over his ears as he stormed down the street,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 43</a><div class="page-content">turning the corner to his tailor shop. His first customer was waiting out front, smiling widely. Zaki tried to keep his temper under control and took out his keys, returning the customer's smile. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Fine day," said the young man.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Gods!" hollered Zaki, sending the young man flying with a well-placed punch, and dashing away. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As much as he hated to admit that Kazagha was right, it was evidently time, once again, for one of the healer's herbal cocktails.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Tarsu's temple to health, mental and physical, was several streets north, an impressive obelisk. Halqa, the chief herbalist, met him before he came in the hall. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"How are you today, Sa'Zaki Saf?" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"I need to make an appointment with Tarsu," said Zaki in his calmest voice. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Just one moment, let me see how his schedule looks." Halqa said, looking over a scroll. "Is this an emergency?" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Kind of," said Zaki, and slapped his head. Why couldn't he say yes, or absolutely, or sure? <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Let's see," said Halqa, frowning. "The best I can do is next Middas. Would that work for you?" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Middas!" cried Zaki. "I'll be a complete psychotic by Middas. Isn't there anything earlier?" He knew what the answer would be before she said it.  There was no alternative. In a way, he had forced the response. If only he had kept the conversation going</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">until "Y". <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"No," said Halqa. "I'm sorry. Do you want me to make the appointment--?" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Zaki walked away, gritting his teeth. He wandered the streets, his head down to avoid all conversations, until he looked up and discovered that he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">had walked all the way to the wharf. A sweet breeze was blowing along the water and he took several deep breaths until he felt almost <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>normal.When<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> his temper cooled, he could think again. What if this alphabetical conversation wasn't a delusion at all?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 43</a><div class="page-content">What if what he felt wasn't paranoia, but acute awareness? He knew it was the classic dilemma: am I crazy or is there really something weird going on? <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Across the road was a shop called ParaDocks, featuring a display of herbs, crystals, and vapors</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 43</a><div class="page-content">trapped in orbs.  The sign in the window read "Mystical Consultation sunrise to noon." It was worth a shot, though Zaki was dubious. The only people who generally came down the wharf for healing were stupid adventurers who didn't know any better.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">ncense burned in copious billows of pink and gold, obscuring and then revealing the clutter within. Jijjic death masks glowered down from the walls, smoking censors hung by chains from the ceiling, and the floor was a maze of bookshelves.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">At a wellworn table in the back a small man wearing a headress was tabulating a young lady's purchases. "Okay," said the man. "Your total comes to fifty-seven gold pieces. I threw in the restorative scale conditioner for free.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 43</a><div class="page-content"> Just remember, the candle should be lit only after you invoke Goroflox The Unholy, and mandrake root does best in partial shade." <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The customer gave a quick, shy smile to Zaki and left the store.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Please help me," said Zaki. "Every conversation I hear or get involved in seems to be arranged alphabetically. I don't know if I'm going insane or if there are some kind of bizarre forces at work.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content"> To be honest with you, I'm normally a skeptic when it comes to your type of business, but I'm at the end of my rope. Can you do anything to make this madness end?" "Quite a common problem, actually," said the man, patting Zaki on the arm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"When you get to the end of the alphabet, do conversations then go to reverse alphabetical order or start at the beginning of the alphabet?" "Reverse alphabetical order," said Zaki, and then corrected himself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 43</a><div class="page-content">. "Damn it! I mean, it starts from the beginning, all over again. I'm in agony. Can you call on the spirits and tell me, am I insane?" <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Sauriki," said the man with a reassuring smile. "I don't have to. You're quite sane."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Thank you," said Zaki, frowning. "By the way, my name's Zaki, not Sauriki." "Unusually close, eh?" said the man, patting Zaki on the back. "My name's Octoplasm. Follow me, please. I think I have just what you need."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Octoplasm lead Zaki down the narrow corridor behind the desk. The two men pushed past dusty cabinets filled with strange creatures in liquids, past heaps of neolithic stones, past stack after stack of moldering leather-bound books, into the dank</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 43</a><div class="page-content">heart of the store. There he picked up a small, squat cylindrical drum and a book, and handed them to Zaki. 'Vampirism, Daedric Possession, and Withershin Therapy,'" said Zaki, squinting his eyes to read the book in the gloom.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"What in Oblivion does this have to do with me? I'm not a vampire, look at this tan. And what's Withershin Therapy, and how much will it cost me?" "Withershins, from the Old Cyrodilic withersynes, which means backwards," said Octoplasm in a serious tone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"It's the art of reversing the direction of things in order to gain access to the spirit world, and break curses,cure vampirism, and trigger all manners of apotropaic healing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 43</a><div class="page-content">You know the story about the guy who was told that slaughterfish live in hot water, so he said, 'Well, let's boil them in cold water'?" "Xenophus," said Zaki instinctively, his brother having taken a rather esoteric upper level course in Cyrodilic</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 43</a><div class="page-content">philosophy as an elective in at the Imperial College thirty-one years before, and immediately wishing he hadn't. "And what do you do with the cylindrical thingy?" Octoplasm lit a candle and held the object over it so Zaki could see more clearly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 43</a><div class="page-content"> All along the cylinder were narrow slits and when Zaki peered within them, he saw a succession of old black and white drawings of a naked man leaping over boxes, one frame after the next.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"You spin it like so," said Octoplasm, slowly whirling the device clockwise so the man within leapt over the boxes over and over again. "It's called a zoetrope. Pretty neat, eh? Now, you take it and start spinning it counterclockwise, and while you're</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 43</a><div class="page-content">doing it, read this incantation I've marked in the book." Zaki took the zoetrope and began spinning it counterclockwise over the candle, so the little naked man within seemed to bound backwards over the boxes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 43</a><div class="page-content">It took a little coordination and concentration to keep whirling at a steady pace, but gradually the man's awkward and jerky backjumps became more and more fluid until Zaki could no longer see the individual frames flipping.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 43</a><div class="page-content">It looked just like a little humanoid hamster on an endless reverse treadmill. While he continued to spin the zoetrope with one hand, Zaki took the book in the other and read the underlined passage.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Zoetrope counter-spin, counter-spin, counter-spin / Pull my life from the rut that it's in / I invoke the Goddesses Boethiah, Kynareth, and Drisis / To invert my potentially metaphysical crisis / My old life may have been rather pointless</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 43</a><div class="page-content">and plain / But I dislike the prospect of going insane / Make the pattern reverse by this withershin / Zoetrope, counter-spin, counter-spin, counter-spin."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 43</a><div class="page-content">As he chanted the spell, Zaki noticed that the little naked man in the zoetrope began to look more like himself. The moustache vanished, and the hairline receded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 43</a><div class="page-content">The man's waistline expanded, and the buttocks sagged to the shape and texture of half-inflated balloons. Scales approximating his own Argonian pattern appeared. The man began to trip as he bounded backwards over the boxes,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 43</a><div class="page-content">taking bigger breaths and sweating. By the time Zaki reached the end of the incantation, his twin was clutching his chest and tumbling end-over-end over the boxes in a free-fall. Octoplasm took the zoetrope and the book from Zaki's hands.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Nothing seemed to have changed. No thunder had rumbled. No winged serpents had sprung out of Zaki's head. No fiery explosions. But Zaki felt that something was different. Good different. Normal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 43</a><div class="page-content">At the counter, when Zaki pulled out his satchel of gold pieces, Octoplasm merely shook his head: "Are treatment radical such of effects term long the what sure be can't we, naturally. Charge no."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Feeling the first real relief he had felt in days, Zaki walked backwards out of the shop and down the road to his shop.
