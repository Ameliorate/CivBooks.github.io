They sneak into our homes,  silently. They touch our funaces when we're not looking. They use our canals when we're not looking. They are real, and they are a threat. The invisible people are real.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 10</a><div class="page-content">The government of Aurora has refused to deal with the threat they reperesent, and ignored the truth because they are corrupt or naive of the reality of the situation. We must act swiftly to deal with the threat to our way of life, or else who knows what</div></div>

With expert advice, I have compiled from across the realm a plan of action has been drawn up to deal with the alien invaders once and for all. A three phase plan has been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 10</a><div class="page-content">drawn up. Each phase must be followed by the next phase for the plan to work properly. There can be no hestitation, our way of life is at stake!</div></div>

Our city must become a fortress of doom for the invisible foe!</div></div>
