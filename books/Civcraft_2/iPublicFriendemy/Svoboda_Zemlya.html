In my travels to the great city of New Leningrad, I was inspired. The monumental buildings, the impressive statues, and the sheer massiveness of the town was to envy! And all from the great</div></div>

But as I admired the city, one thing stood out to me: the lack of freedom. Architecure was strictly stone. Citizens lived in cramped apartments, and VIPs lived in rooms no bigger than a basic hutt. The basic freedoms Senntistens</div></div>

But the buildings! The STRENGTH! Oh, how I wished that Senntisten could become so grand. To be free from Orion control, and prosper into its own superpower! But what would Senntisten be without freedom?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 38</a><div class="page-content">So I thought. Of a way to grow Senntisten to the size of New Leningrad. A new dawn in the land of freedom...

A free proletariate's
utopia.

Soon after its founding, it surged in popularity. Newfriends flocked to the town, welcomed with open arms, a plot of land and a chance at life.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 38</a><div class="page-content">With these newfriends came new ideas. The idea of a free and independent Senntisten spread quickly, and demands were made to make the town its own nation.

Orionites refused, demanding they stay allegiant. Senntisten leaders eventually</div></div>

While Senntisten was not given it's independece, its status was changed to a colony of Orion. Despite this, many see it as a dominion.

Tension and pressure for freedom grow,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 38</a><div class="page-content">Why has New Leningrad grown to such sizes? Is it because of the leaders instilled? The resources surrounding them?
Absolute luck of the draw? No. It is becuase of one person.

The Worker.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The Workers of Minecraft are what keep the wheels of life moving. You may ask, who is a worker? Well the answer is quite simple. Everyone is. The house you built with the wood you chopped makes you a worker. The sword you made from the diamond you mined</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 38</a><div class="page-content">makes you a worker. The life you built and the relationships you made all make you a worker.

But workers can not prosper alone. When a group of workers band together against the evils and troubles of the work, they create towns.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 38</a><div class="page-content">These towns are the basis of CivCraft, and they make us what we are today.

New Leningrad began as a any other town, with the dream of greatness. Rules were established early, stating that each worker not only works for themselves, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 38</a><div class="page-content">for each and every worker alive. Workers were not rivals, but brothers and sisters. They built for eachother, gave to eachother, lived for eachother. They allowed anyone to work and anyone to eat. All were equal.

This must be followed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 38</a><div class="page-content">by those of Senntisten. But the freedoms that we've always had, what of them? These freedoms will be an absolute right. But how would we go about this? How can we grow Senntisten, and work towards our independence?

       The Order
         of  the
      Proletariate





~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 38</a><div class="page-content">What is the Order of the Proletariate?

The Order would be a group of 6 permenant citizens of Senntisten. Within this group, at least 2 members must have been a citizen for over 1 month. This ensures that there are multiple members who understand the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 38</a><div class="page-content">basics of CivCraft.

The oldest member is considered the Proletarian leader.

The Order will decide on laws and proposals put forth by the people of Senntisten. The people will vote for their leader, except for three</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 38</a><div class="page-content">positions. These positions are to be held by the King, SeldomShock, and two citizens of his choosing. Should he or his choices step down, be pearled, leave, or otherwise become unable to serve, they will be replaced by the new king and/or new choices.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 38</a><div class="page-content">What will society revolve around?

Similar to in Leningrad, society will revolve around working for the greater good of Senntisten. But, unlike Leningrad, the greater good will include the freedom and equality of the proletariate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 38</a><div class="page-content">The people of Senntisten will be entitled to 3 basic rights:
1) Right to free speech, press and religion.
2) Right to personal property and whatever built on it.
3) Right to citizenship to the great city of
Senntisten.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 38</a><div class="page-content">All laws and proposals must adhere to these, as decided by the Order. The laws and proposals must be passed by at least 3/4 of the Order members, and go into effect immediately.

Those seeking citizenship into Senntisten must</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 38</a><div class="page-content">be logged for safety reasons, and must have a fairly clean criminal record. Those who have associated with well known griefers or are currently wanted are not allowed for the safety of others.

Once these criminals have been considered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 38</a><div class="page-content">reformed and/or served their sentence, they may once again apply for citizenship to the great city of Senntisten.

Should any citizen be found to be commiting crimes against infringing on these rights, they will be pearled and dealt with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 38</a><div class="page-content">by the Order. If they are found to be an enemy of the state, commiting multiple acts of violence, griefing, or any other heinous act, their buildings will be torn down, their possetions siezed and their citizenship revoked. All building materials will be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 38</a><div class="page-content">held in reserves, while tools, food, and equipment will be given to merchants to be sold, used to arm guards/soldiers, or given out to citizens.


Pearling will be swift and just. Pearlings, along with evidence, must be brough to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 38</a><div class="page-content">the Order via reddit within 24 hours of the pearling. Otherwise, the pearl must be released. Should someone be unjustly pearled or pearled without evidence, they will be released, and may persue charges on the pearler.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 38</a><div class="page-content">How would we instill this order? How will we bring down our Orion oppressors?

One word.

Work.

A pickaxe will get Senntisten closer to independece than a sword ever will. The</div></div>

Several districts will be assigned for differant reasons. Residential districts will house the people of Senntisten on plots of land, all being of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 38</a><div class="page-content">farely similar size. New citizens will be given a plot, and may build on it however they may choose.

Recreational districts will be home to parks, attractions, and so on. Citizens may pay a fee to build on a small portion of land, otherwise the state</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 38</a><div class="page-content">will hire workers to build parks, monuments, and so on.

Business districts will house businesses, shops, and mines. Citizens may pay a weekly fee to own a business in the area. The Order must first approve of the business. Alleviated</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 38</a><div class="page-content">funds will go to the production of tools and armor, as well as paying for workers and builders.

Farming districts will hold wheat, mellon, carrot, nether and obsidian farms. They will be maintained and owned by the state, not privately. Citizens</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 38</a><div class="page-content">will be encouraged to work in these farms to collect basic needs.

Finally, there is the government district. This will only be a small area, but will hold some of the most important buildings of Senntisten. Vaults, storage, the Palace and other</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 38</a><div class="page-content">government buildings will be housed here. There will also be a "Proletariate Department," who's job is to hire workers for projects.

With these districts, order may be more efficiently held within the confines of town.</div></div>
