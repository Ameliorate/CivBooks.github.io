<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"Now, we have to realize that civcraft and the real world are two different things, even if we try to balance them. In the real world, the success of state or city is often related to its past history, resources, and geopolitical or physical position."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"In civcraft, we have a few differences. First, physical position is important, but travel by boat isn\u0027t the most viable source of transportation as it once was. Port cities don\u0027t necessarily succeed in civcraft. Freshwater isn\u0027t necessary. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"That being said, places with strong trade are those which are close together, because players want to move shorter distances to move. This means that most cities will be built where others are, and in a central position so that they are easily accessible."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"We see this in the map. Most successful towns are located in the center.  How do we gauge a town\u0027s success? You could say that a high population indicates a high standard of living due to people\u0027s willingness to live there, as opposed to the real world -"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"where people have less ability to migrate. Wealth, of course, indicates resources, and creates trade. Trade is a good indicator of success because it accounts for the town\u0027s high demand and output of resources aswell as a substantial population, which is-"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">necessary for trade. So population, wealth, and physical or geopolitical positions all matter when creating a town. That being said, what is the best list of characteristics for a town to succeed? The location.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">We need:
-proximity to transportation and other cities

-diverse biomes to offer many potential resources (plains/forest, jungle, desert)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"So, place a town in this spot and we have our next empire, right? No. That\u0027s not right. Civcraft is more than just that. With a radius of 15 km and therefore area of about 707 km2, it\u0027s is fucking massive, but that doesn\u0027t mean everything is in a macro -"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"scale. The world map is about the same size as Singapore, and the population is much less. Everything happening is at a micro-scale. It\u0027s less easy to predict things when personal relations impact the world more than most things. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"That is what creates a successful city. A group of people all pledged to each other. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"Fuck, well I\u0027ve just been procrastinating on an AP Human essay. Am I good at bullshitting?"</div></div>
