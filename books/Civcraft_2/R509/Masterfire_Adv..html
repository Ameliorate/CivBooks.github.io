<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Masterfire would have to go to one of the most cancerous places ever- the city of Commonwealth. Masterfire knew that there would be Ink Sacs in the Commonwealth, ready for him to purchase. Getting to the CW was easy, just a walk/swim heading south.</div></div>

"lol XD ROFL" he could hear from within the city. Cancer is known to be harmful to people, and even the great hero of Masterfire is not invunerable. Setting foot into the city he began</div></div>

He felt slightly better walking away from the city. Eventually he fell down a hill, sustaining damage. He was then attacked by a horde of 50 zombies, which he killed single-handedly. After some time, a</div></div>

Trying to head down a mountain, he still didn't feel good. He lost his balance on the mountain, vomiting a 13th time and falling. His face slammed into the vomit covered rock, killing him and leaving behind a mix of vomit</div></div>

Respawning in Mire, he sent someone well to go get the Ink Sacs, which were brought to the L.I.E.S. donation chest.
