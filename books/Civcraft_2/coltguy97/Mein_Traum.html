    We all have dreams, whether it be to rule or to love, we all do it. I had a dream. My dream was to start again. I came from a dying city that I watched crumble before my very eyes. I sat by as many dear friends dissappeared</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Cities that used to inspire aww now lay in silence. I hated it, so I decided to start new. I journeyed from fellowship, came to orion, lived as a hermit, then came to reside here in Senntisten. I thought I would enjoy being around people, I heard nothing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">but great things about Orion. I guess you can't trust everything you hear...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2 "Reality"

 After living under Orion rule, I've seen it's dark side. Violence, death, greifing, accusations, and a town decimated. All through these events a Orion official wasn't far away. Ready to ignore the truth and deal with it as they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">pleased. The way I see it, the Orionites show no care to the safety or well being of those outside of the main city. We are treated as their pets, used to show their pride. I am sick of it. Now there's only one thing to answer...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3 "Where We Go"

 The big question. There's no use complaining if you can't come up with solutions. Which I have. The plan is simple. For Orion to know they cannot mistreat us, we must show them what happens when you</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">beat a dog for long enough, that it bites back. I am no way endorsing any acts of violence on Orion. No, violence shows nothing except not controling your emotions. The way we fight must be fought without a drop of blood. We must seperate ourselves from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">their rule. Show that they can no longer show us off as their own. Cause when we show they can't control us, the world no longer sees their "strength" They see the true Orion, the Orion I see everyday. Whether it be being ignored or fearing for my life</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">walking the streets of Orion. And when we acclompished this, only then, can we achieve our dreams...
