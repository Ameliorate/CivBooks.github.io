<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Once there was an angry little squid. The squid would sit in his house all day being angry. One day, a little wild man walked past the squid's house. The squid spotted the wild man and shouted, "HEY YOU MOTHER FUCKER, GET OFF MY FUCKING PROPERTY YOU CUNT"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">The wild man  was got off guard by this. "Wow m8 can you not be a fucking cunt for a sec u wanker. That was quite rude of you and I will not tolerate this." The squid  went from a blueberry blue to a lava red.

The wild man and the colt went to the squid's house. "WHAT ARE YOU CUNTS DOING IN MY AREA, GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE I KILL YOU DAMN CUN--" a bullet went threw his skull. He was dead way before he hit the ground. The colt put his...</div></div>
