one thing,
I don't know why,
doesnt even matter
how hard I try.
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
to explain in due time,
all I know.
Time is a valuable 
thing,
watch it fly by as the
pendulum swings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Watch it count down
to the end of the day. The clock ticks 
life away.
It's so unreal.
Didn't look out below.
Watch the time go
right out the window.
Tried to hold on
but didn't even know
I wasted it all
just to
watch you go.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">I kept everything inside
even though I tried,
it all fell apart.
What it meant to me
will eventually be
a memory of a time
I tried so hard,
and got so far, 
but in the end,
it doesn't even matter. I had to fall,
to lose it all,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">but in the end,
it doesn't even matter. One thing.
I don't know why. 
It doesn't even matter how hard I try.
Keep that in mind,
I designed this rhyme,
to remind myself how
I got so far.
Things aren't the way
they were before.
You wouldn't even</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 8</a><div class="page-content">recognize me anymore. Not that you knew me
back then, 
but it all comes back
to me
in the end.
I kept everything inside 
and even though I tried,
it all fell apart.
What it meant to me
will eventually be</div></div>

Pushed as far as
I can go.</div></div>
