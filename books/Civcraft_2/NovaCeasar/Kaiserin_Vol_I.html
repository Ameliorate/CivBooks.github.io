<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The City of Kaiserin is the capitol of the Commonwealth of the Kaiserinreich, a nation located in the northern minus minus. Founded in late September of 2014, it has since grown to be a moderately large and prosperous city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The City of Kaiserin was founded in September of 2014 as a colony of the late Hogereich, the Kaiserinreichs predecessor with a similar governmental structure and populous.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Founded while the Hogereich was in a state of decline, the colony of Kaiserin was initially started in the Great Northern Caverns as a mere rail station on the way to the desert territory of Deseret as a way to store goods and allow for faster trading.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The status of Kaiserin changed however in early October when explorers found that the cavern itself was mostly flat and quite suitable for making a larger colony.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">This, coupled with the HCF invasions of around the time, made the place seem like an ideal hidden city, and a large number of resources and people began to flow into the new colony.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Growth continued for some time as a Hogereich colony, when sometime in early November/late October the Hogereich leader NovaCeasar made contact with a northern nation called Volterra, lead by an informal Emperor (at that time), named Mickale.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Upon contact with the Volterrans, Kaiserin, which was bordered on the north by them, became a much more funded and supported city in order to foster trade and for the first time in Hogereich history, hopefully gain a friend in the region and perhaps ally.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 31</a><div class="page-content">With the growth of Kaiserin came the increasingly faster decline of Hogeklif, the capitol of the Hogereich. So much so that by the middle of November, it was decided that the Hogereich should be dissolved, and a new nation know as the Kaiserinreich would</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 31</a><div class="page-content">Around the time of the official reorganization,there was the crowning of the Volterran Emperor Mickale, with which the newly established Kaiserinreich attended. Afterwards a shaky alliance was established between the two nations in the hopes of stability</div></div>

Sadly however an earlier border agreement, having only been vocal and not well defined, allowed for border issues to arise with the creation of the Valleran settlement above the cavern in which Kaiserin City was built.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 31</a><div class="page-content">However tensions began to grow upon the signing of a treaty with SPQR, in which the two representatives, NovaCeasar and Mickale, were not on the same page information wise due to either a lie or blunder from the Roman ambassador.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The effects of the treaty showed several flaws in the Confederacy, and a week or so after the Vendemmian revolt rose in the Volterran Province. It was under this that the Volterran Emperor seized his opportunity to take control of the Valleran Confederacy</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 31</a><div class="page-content">The breakup of the Confederacy lead to a micro-war between the former states, creating a bitter divide between the CKR and the Volterran State.
