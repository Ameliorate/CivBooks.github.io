My name is Gerbil_9 and this is a grand story of drunken ramblings and great adventure of the great and amazing and drunk Gerbil_9. It begins in a town called Fellowship and ends with Gerbil being basically amazing, sexy, and basically jesus.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">It all begins in the town of Fellowship, as I mentioned before. The town wanted to purchase wither skulls in order to create a beacon. Oreo, being oreo, was not involved. Every time Oreo gets involved with something involving any substantial amount of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">dimmenz... well... he loses it.

So, the town of Fellowship pooled their money all together and couldn't purchase a single wither skull because, well, they're poor as fuck. Gerbil, being awesome and rich (don't forget sexy)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">generously donated a billion dimmenz in order to allow the impoverished, but amazing town of Fellowship, to purchase a wither in order to get a beacon. Why they didn't just get a portal farm is beyond the great and honorable Gerbil, but he donated to the</div></div>

So, having amassed the dimmenz that they needed, the all hopped on the rails towards carson. Except, they started going East to Holy Tree instead of towards Carson, which is west. Gerbil thought this was silly, but went along with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">peasant class anyway in order to humor them on their journey. Gerbil does not let himself get bothered with such petty matters like time and travel.

Gerbil continues on the rails with the crew, when suddenly, a wild NICO attacks!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Nico, being jealous of the labor being done on Gerbil's plot by the wonderful and helpful Manda (IT'S MANDAAAAA) decided that this was unfair and attacked Manda! Gerbil, being a benevolent manager, and townskeeper, would have none of this. He ordered nico</div></div>

Eldoorn, Mulificus, and Gerbil all jumped off their minecarts in their shining prot IV to apprehend the criminal scum and bring him to justice, when out of nowhere, a wild NeonCoffee appeared to defend the Nico. "Why does Neon insist on being</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">"bad?" gerbil thinks to himself. A great fight ensues. Everyone throws pots all around, Neon starting with a few debuffs, and Gerbil starting by supplying his allies with regens, as they were not fully prepared for a fight. Eldoorn, Mulificus, and Gerbil,</div></div>

Disaster strikes again, however,</div></div>

For now...</div></div>
