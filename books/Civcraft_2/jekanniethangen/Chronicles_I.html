<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 14</a><div class="page-content">MY first day on CivCraft was so.. so long ago. I met a nice fellow named Rasmase. He showed me his little village, and told me I could stay in his hotel for free. And thats exactly what I did. I helped him with landscaping, with making the mines.. and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">HE paid me good iron for it. But after a while, I felt underpaid.. For all the hard work that I did, he barely gave me anything anymore. He told me I could buy a plot for 5d. .....
5D??!?!?!
No way Jos√©! 
I didn't mind that much at first. But it was the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">beginning of a whole adventure.. MY adventure. These are my Chronicles. I will write these Chronicles to tell my story. The story of how I got rich.. or how I died at the hands of mercenaries who are mad at me for my bad deeds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Yes, 
I am the one who covered Lawnia in dirt. A shitload of it. Like someone crapped on the village. He dare charging me for a plot? After everything I did? He charge me over and over for stuff I don't need, like a participation to one</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">of his stupid arena fights, which I had to pay for MYSELF. He wasa conman. He conned new players out of their stuff. So yeah, he got what he deserved. I covered that village like a toilet at a Indian restaurant.

But, that' not all.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I slaughtered at least 16 chickens.
7 horses.
Countless sheep and cows, I don't even remember.
I plundered what I could. I had to. I deserved it.

I set up camp. I called it fort hope. I placed it close to Lawnia..</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">A tunnel connects the ruins of Lawnia right to my bunker. From there, there's a path to my farm, Fort Hope Farms, where I try to make a living as a farmer. Wheat mostly. Precious wheat. With the rise of the Bread Party in carbon, which is close to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">Fort Hope Farms, I hope to bang some bucks out of it. Anyways.

Fast forward some weeks. I come across Mount Augusta. A lovely city, really. I got a free plot. I didn't know they were affiliated with Rasmase or Lawnia</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">in any way. zaphod100 though.. He recognized me. Fuck. 
I brushed it off, saying I was new to CivCraft, how I didn't know him. 
In the meanwhile I built a nice house in Mount Augusta. With a well in the backyard, with an emergency exit leading to the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">graveyard. The gravestone read: "Big motherfucker, small gravestone", which means that someone who does bad things, or a motherfucker, won't be missed by anyone and thus, he or she will have a small gravestone. Does that apply to me?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I don't know. I hope not. Zaphod100 seemed to have thought otherwise. He asked me if I ever heard of Lawnia, and I repeated the same story.

That was stupid. He caught me. I had to get the fuck out of there. I jumped in the well.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">I was reading the chat. He was summing up all the attrocites I commited in Lawnia. Fuck, I regret it so!
I just wanted to build things and play minecraft, with other people, but I got suckered into CivCraft. I felt as if my story just started.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">And that is how this first volume of The Jekanniethangen Chronicles ends. Zaphod100 waited at the gravestone. How did he know? Did he accidentally find me? Or was he into me the whole time? I fled back to my bunker. My vault. My treasure room.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">There, these volumes will be written. I hope to spread my story to the people of CivCraft.. That it may be a relic of an expiriment that once was.</div></div>
