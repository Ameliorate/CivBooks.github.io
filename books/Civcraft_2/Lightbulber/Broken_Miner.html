The only occasional light that you find is a fiery pit of magma but you've not seen any of that demonic substance for many days now. Just darkness. All there is for you down here is</div></div>

You've not even seen any gravel for two days now. Just cobble. No dirt either, just cobble. Your diamond pick axe broke a week ago and all you have left is</div></div>

You start making chickens and villagers out of cobble. Anything to give yourself the illusion of having company down in the dark depths of cobble. Soon your cobble chicken starts clucking</div></div>
