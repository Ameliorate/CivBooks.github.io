__________________

Act 1:

Masketta Man arrives with the hostages, CIA introduces himself to Doctor Paveleer.

Voices: CIA</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Welcome, Doctor, I'm CIA
Those are my men and this is my plane

As for the friends you don't get to bring
(Masketta Man) 
He wasn't alone, but I'm not charging</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Seldom do you see
Loyal guns like me
Agent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the plane,
keeper of the Bane
Ready to relieve 'em
of the extreme pain

Pulling off the mask,
making up the plan
Lotta loyalty for a hired gun!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Everybody loves a big guy
Mercenary, masked man

I will shoot a hired gun
before throwing him out of a plane!


The airplane lifts off, end of Act I.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Act II :

In the air, CIA interrogates the prisoners. Bane is still keeping the hood on to mask his presence.

Voices: Cia, Bane</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">CIA:

There, out in the darkness
A masked man running
Fallen from god
Fallen from Grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
'til we come mask to face
'til we come mask to face</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">He knows his way in the dark
Mine is the way of the agency
And those who follow the plan of the flighteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall
As Juan Ovus fell
The Bane!
On board!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Planes
In your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the airspace
with plans of flight
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall
As Juan Ovus fell
You fall for Bane!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">And so it has been and so it is written
On the flightplan to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price!

Lord let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest
Until then
This I swear</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">This I swear by the planes!

Bane:

That CIA thinks he's something
But it's me who crashes this plane!
And my fire never lapses
And my brothers never frown
Trust Bane,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">have no fear
Don't you worry, Pavel dear
That comes later, not right here!

End of Act II.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Act III : 

CIA reluctantly removes the hood from the last prisoner, revealing Bane himself.

Voices : CIA, Bane, Paveleer</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">CIA :

BANE? At last!
We see each other plain
Masked mercenary
I have you on my plane

Bane : 
Before you ask another question, CIA
Before you claim to be in charge here</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Listen to me!
There is something I must do
Dr. Pavel left behind many questions
We had to see what he told you-

(Dr. Paveleer interrupts the music yelling "nothing! I said nothing!", Bane glares at him before he continues to sing.)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Now that we know
It's time to crash this plane!


Banes hired guns assault the airplane, escape with Dr. Paveleer in Banes own plane, the 2big4U and crash CIA's plane.

End of Act III.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Act IV.

CIA is falling to his death, thinking about his life and making peace with the mortal plain (or plane? BRAVO NOLAN!)

Voices: CIA</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When I looked fly, in those grassy plains
I dreamed the flight plan wouldn't die
I dreamed that Pavel would not bring friends

When I was young, and looked for Bane
Mosquito came, no charge for them</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">I told them "get aboard my plane"
And then I shot them and threw 'em out

But a Big guy talks at last
With a voice all muffled and lame
As he talks about his past
And reveals himself as BANE!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Although the chap was very large
He couldn't escape, I had caught my man
He made me feel I was in charge
But it was all part of his plan

Then he rose up and came to me
It was the end, the fire rises</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 22</a><div class="page-content">A single punch, I was asleep
He crashed the plane with no survivors

I had a dream, in charge I'd be
I had so many belts to grab on
And big guys to flirt with me
But Bane has killed the dream I dreamed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 22</a><div class="page-content">End of Act IV.
