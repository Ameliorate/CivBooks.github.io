Traps

Degenerates have always been suboptimal human beings, but some are worse offenders to both the eye and the mind than others.
This book will be your guide to spotting, analyzing and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">removing one of the worst kinds of degenerates: Traps.

Traps are individuals who have a mental illness that makes them believe they are not a man while blissfully ignoring that they piss out of a dick every morning after waking up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">To make up for missing the parts that make a woman a woman, they tend to try and adopt female behaviour, like speaking in a high pitched voice to conceal their adams apple or growing long, greasy hair to hide manly facial features behind it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">While easily spotted in real life (shoulder and hips width, mustache, strong chin, a voice like a gay man, bad fashion sense and constant pissyness) most of these characteristics are not visible when dealing with them online.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">One of the first signs of dealing with a trap is the need of the trap to declare its pseudo-feminity almost immediately when they introduce themselves. Like men, women tend to focus on the game or on current talks rather than spouting about their implyied</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">vagina (you are fooling nobody traps) the first chance they get.
If you however ask for a picture or suggest a video chat, the trap shies away immediately and makes up some weak excuse of a defect camera or being somewhere not at home.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">If you were dealing with a female attention whore up to this point she would've followed up on the video chat offer to further gain attention, the trap however declines because it knows that it cannot deceive a careful watcher.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Another characteristic of the common trap is its belief that, to pass as a woman, they have to act like spoiled brats and nag, deceive and generally trample on your nerves as much as possible while forgetting this is a biological phenomenon experienced by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">actual women only once a month over a period (hurr durr) no longer than 7 days.
So, if an implyied girl is pissy, rude and unnerving 24/7, its not a woman, its a dude with his dick tucked behind his thighs.

Now after we have established some key</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">points that make a trap, here is a list of things to do to get rid of them:

1. constantly misgender them, it drives them insane
2. point out they do not possess ovaries
3. do the armchair psychologist, they hate it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">4. remind them of the sorrow they bring their poor mother
5. hunt them out of town with torches and pitchforks
6. deny them every rights because obviously mentally ill people cannot make sound decisions</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">A last note:

Whatch out for deprived orbiters, lesser men than normal orbiters trying to get some snu snu from another man dressed in cheap underwear from their own mother. These disgusting fellows are so poonstarved</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">they consider a mans asshole an acceptable place for their dong.
A mercy kill would be a favour to them, so when you see them running after a trap,  do not hesitate and end their suffering.</div></div>
