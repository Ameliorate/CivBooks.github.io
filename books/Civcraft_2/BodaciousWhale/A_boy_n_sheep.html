<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">understands me crusty." bill began to shed tears. And with the prepubescent tears that bill shed, something magical happened. The coat was penetrated and began to become wet, and for the first time in 4 years crusty felt the sweet sensation of well,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">"feeling. You see, since Bill came on crusty so many times, crusty was not able to see out his eyes because they were shut, or hear out his ears because they were clogged.
