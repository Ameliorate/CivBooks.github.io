He was now alt-banned, just like everyone else in his crew. They had a good run in their eyes, but PapaPound still felt like he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 35</a><div class="page-content">could have done more. Maybe he did want total ruin to come to the server by his own hand.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>N</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>ot like it mattered anymore. It was over. His reign was done and he did enough damage to cement himself a name along with the rest of the shitheads</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 35</a><div class="page-content">who fucked with Civcraft. Even though he was in the End, he still stood with his chest puffed out like some love-crazed bird, proud of what he had accomplished.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>P</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>apa was working on his crappy end base when his chat alerted him to someone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 35</a><div class="page-content">picking his pearl up out of the chest he was trapped in. Clone2204. What did he want now? He was probably going to summon him and gloat about how he was defeated now, which seemed like something Clone would do. Soon enough, Papa was summoned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 35</a><div class="page-content">His items left strewed on the ground in the End. Bright light attacked his eyes and Papa cringed from it, a hand trying to block it out. After he adjusted, he looked up to see Clone standing there smirking, pearl in hand.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“Hello, Papa.” His smirk grew. “How are you?”
PapaPound stayed silent, sure that if he said one thing it would turn the situation into 
something different. Instead, he declined to answer, choosing to ask his own question.
“Why’d you summon me?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“Mmmm, I think you know why.”

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>H</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>e did, but something about today...Something about Clone seemed different. Clone had a gleam in his eye like never before, as if he had something planned. “What is your suggestion today?” Papa questioned as</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 35</a><div class="page-content">he eyed Clone in his enchanted diamond armor.
“Well, I had a few ideas, but firstly,” He held up a lead, just like the ones for horses, “I’m 
tying you up.”

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>P</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>apa had never really thought about getting tied up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Personally, he had never liked being tied down, metaphorically or literally, but the way Clone suggested it... more like ordered it... already Papa was interested. He’d never admit it, but he loved to be ordered around. The only other person who knew was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Clone and of course, he always took advantage of it.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>C</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>lone knotted the last few bit of rope and Papa was tied to a fence, on his knees. He glanced up at Clone, his face slightly flushed considering he was right in front of Clone’s crotch.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“What are we doing first... Sir?” Clone’s bottom lip was trapped between his teeth as soon as Papa referred to him as ‘Sir’. God, he loved when he said that to him. “I think you can suck my cock, darling.” He unbuttoned his pants and stepped closer,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 35</a><div class="page-content">unzipping them 
and pulled out his trouser snake. Papa smirked as Clone rubbed his cock against his face, not letting him actually start. Clone teased him just a bit longer before he held himself out, pumping to get stiff. Papa licked and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 35</a><div class="page-content">lapped at the tip of Clone’s penis before it was shoved into his mouth.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>I</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>t may have seemed harsh, but Papa loved it. His cheeks hollowed as he went to town on Clone’s meat, enjoying every bit of it, rolling his tongue on the underside.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 35</a><div class="page-content">He gagged briefly and Clone pulled out of his mouth, checking to see if Papa was alright. The vault breaker nodded and opened his mouth, ready for more. Clone stuffed his dick back into Papa’s gaping mouth, trying to resist the urge to thrust into his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 35</a><div class="page-content">mouth.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>A</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>fter a few moans, Clone couldn’t help himself, his hand that was laying gently on Papa’s head curled into a fist, grabbed hair and he thrust forward into the other’s mouth. It felt so good, so he did it again and again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 35</a><div class="page-content">He could hear Papa gag hard a few times as his cock went down his throat, but the hums from the bound man solidified that he was enjoying it.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>S</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>uddenly Clone pulled out gasping, trying not to cum. A few coughs came from the criminal as he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 35</a><div class="page-content">licked his lips, looking thoroughly pleased. He looked up to the Rush fan and grinned, “Can you last long enough to fuck me?”

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>C</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>lone laughed, “Fuck yeah!” He untied Papa and shoved him over the fence.
”Wait, wait wait..." Papa suddenly said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Clone stopped and stepped away, thinking he overstepped the line.
“I want you to tie me up again. I want you to not touch me. I want you to pound me so hard.”
Clone’s eyes widened. This wasn’t like Papa, he was never this demanding before.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“Are you sure?”
“Please, Sir. Please fuck me hard.”
Clone swallowed down a moan, not letting Papa know how hot that made him.
 
  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>S</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>oon, Papa was tied up again. Hands behind his back and face in the dirt. Oh, how he felt like a dirty little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 35</a><div class="page-content">slut with his ass in the air. Lube dripped from a bottle hitting his ass and slipping between the crack. Clone smeared it over his hole, using his fingers to slip some inside. 
“How does that feel?”
“Good. Very good, would be better if it was your dick.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 35</a><div class="page-content">“Soon, babe.”

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>A</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> finger slipped inside Papa and teased him. It felt good, but he didn’t need to be stretched. He wasn’t new to this. “Will you just stick your cock in already?!” Clone smirked, deciding instead to tease Papa terribly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 35</a><div class="page-content">He continued probing him with one finger as Papa continued to writhe and complain. Eventually Clone made it to two, and Papa still whined. Clone kept going, a terrible grin growing on his face with every additional grumble from the outlaw.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 35</a><div class="page-content">  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>W</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>hen he finally slipped in a third finger, Papa lost it. “Oh, please Clone. Stop fucking teasing me and just fuck me! Please! I’m on the fucking edge and you won’t let me fucking blow my load. Your skinny pencil fingers aren’t getting me anywhere!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Clone started howling with laughter, it must have been how desperate Papa sounded. He felt bad for laughing, because he didn’t mean to, but it just came out. “I’m sorry, okay?”
“Don’t fucking apologize. Shut the hell up and stick me, you cock.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 35</a><div class="page-content">Clone obliged by pouring more lube on and getting ready. He spread Papa apart and slipped his hardened sword into the other’s quivering, awaiting love hole. A sigh of relief and pleasure shuddered from Papa as Clone began to slowly thrust into him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 35</a><div class="page-content">The coolpvper thrust deep, finding Papa’s prostate and ramming into it. Papa wailed in ecstasy as he rocked back into Clone trying to get more of it.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>T</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>he Rush superfan leaned forward to whisper into Papa’s ear. “Call me a dirty collaborator,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 35</a><div class="page-content"> because I love giving you my goods.”
He quickened his pace, because he could feel Papa shaking underneath him, just ready to explode. Papa began to beg again, “Faster, Clone. For fuck sake, faster, I need to cum! Make me cum!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 35</a><div class="page-content">  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>C</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>lone wasn’t speeding up now; he loved to fuck with Papa. He knew deep down, Papa loved it too. He loved being degraded and fucked and talked down to. What Clone didn’t know, was Papa knew the secret to making Clone blow his load too early.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 35</a><div class="page-content">There was one thing in the entire world that Clone could not resist.

And that was Rush.

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>P</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>apa began to sing in a strained voice, it wasn’t loud, but it was just enough for Clone to hear over his huffing. “<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>You can choose a ready </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 35</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>guide in some celestial voice. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>”
“oOOOH MY GOD” Clone exclaimed. He stopped thrusting for a brief second in shock, but then he was ready. He was going to cum. He started fucking Papa,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 35</a><div class="page-content">absolutely pounding him.
“<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill I will choose a path that's clear!</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>”

  <span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>F</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>inally, the two of them came at the same exact time, jizz was everywhere. Papa’s thighs were soaked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 35</a><div class="page-content">and it was dripping out his ass. Clone pulled out, slightly slumped over Papa. They were both breathless, but Clone managed to quiet sing out,

“<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>I will choose freewill...</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>”</div></div>
