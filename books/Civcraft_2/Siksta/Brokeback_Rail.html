  Brokeback Railway
       By Siksta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"  Ryden was creating a batch of beacons when he got a message from one of his fellow citizens. When he heard that Sandfalls was looking for help moving obsidian, he decided to jump at the chance. Sandfalls was someone he’d been interested in for a while. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps the long trip from Titan to Centauri would be the right chance to get closer to him and possibly ask him out. He sent a message back to Sand and got ready to meet him in Carbon.

 His trip to Carbon was calm and uneventful, but his nervousness</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"was mounting. It was just going to be him and Sandfalls, alone, riding the long lonely rails. God, he was nervous as hell. He wondered what the right time would be to make a move. What if Sand didn’t feel the same back? Even though Ryden flirted with Sand"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 43</a><div class="page-content">a few times and the other returned the advances, he was never sure if Sand was serious or not.

 Soon enough he arrived at Carbon. He could hear the chants of the Bread Riots above the rail station and questioned if it was safe to go up and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 43</a><div class="page-content">meet his friend. He began climbing the stairs eagerly, despite the clamour of the people above, but he bumped into the very man he was looking for.
“Sand! Sounds crazy up there.”
“Yeah,” Sand replied, “Two guys got pearled and now people are rioting.” He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 43</a><div class="page-content">walked over to the rail and laid his cart on the tracks. “Let’s get out of here and head to Titan.”
Ryden gave a nod in agreement and followed after his crush.

 They rode the rail for thirty minutes and Ryden offered to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"how Sand around Titan. When they arrived, Sandfalls excitedly followed Ryden, admiring the town. He commented on all the builds he liked, spending a good time complimenting the stables just recently built. He mentioned how much he liked Ryden’s house"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">a few times, which made the leader’s stomach feel like it was being swarmed by hundreds of butterflies. Ryden tried to keep his smile subtle, but the praise was just too satisfying.

 Soon enough, he suggested the two of them should start gathering the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">obsidian and head out. He led SandFalls to the room with all the obsidian stored and they began filling their inventories. They were taking their time as Sand made idle chat, with Ryden replying with simple answers.
“Hey, Ryden?”
“Hmm?”
“Are you and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Shady...Are you actually a thing?”
Ryden stopped moving obsidian to chest carts and glanced at SandFalls, “I...No, it’s just a joke. I mean, he’s cool and all, but I’m not like that.”
“Oh,” Sand looked down and tried to distract himself from the answer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">He was extremely disappointed because he believed all his flirting was for naught. Maybe all of the joking passes were really just nothing but jokes for Ryden.

 Ryden saw the reaction from the other and realised he had upset him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 43</a><div class="page-content">somehow. He thought that Sand might be happy, but maybe he was mistaken. Instead, he found himself even more confused. “Hey, did I say something wrong?”
SandFalls stared at Ryden and their eyes locked for a moment in that dark SRO box.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 43</a><div class="page-content">He stepped towards Ryden and glanced at his feet before speaking, “Ryden, I don’t know if I should say this because it might ruin our friendship, but I really like you, as in ‘want to sleep with you’ like you.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 43</a><div class="page-content">" Ryden found himself frozen, unsure what to say. His dreams had practically come true and here he was dumbstruck. What should he say? What should he do? He still couldn’t find the right words, and Sand was looking even more upset. He was about to turn"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"away when Ryden grabbed the other’s shoulder and turned him back around, leaning forward while pulling SandFalls closer to him. Their lips touched and it felt awkward at first, but Sand relaxed and leaned into the kiss, his arms wrapping around"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Ryden’s neck and waist. 
 They had both waited ages for this moment and like hell they were gonna let it slip by too quickly. Sand deepened the kiss, tongue lapping at Ryden’s lips in eagerness as he pushed the leader against a wall of the cold obsidian.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"Ryden had to admit he was surprised at the other’s forwardness, but he didn’t shun it. Instead, his hands slid up under the hard leather of Sand’s armor. He knew they wouldn’t be bothered here, so he decided to see how far he could go."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 43</a><div class="page-content">" It had been a minute or two since they began making out and neither of them seemed interested in stopping, but a noise outside the SRO box startled them. They quickly stepped away from each other and Ryden licked his lips before checking outside the"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"door. It seemed like someone had just walked by, but the commotion caught them off guard and ruined the moment. Instead of continuing, they both agreed they should start heading towards Centauri. They quickly loaded up the carts and set them off, "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 43</a><div class="page-content">beginning to make the trek by rail.

 They encountered some issues on the diagonal rails and kept getting pushed back by the chested valuables. They laughed about it at first, but became frustrated after it happened additional times.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Finally they made it to Xiphias and took a moment to take a break, finding some food and drink. At a quiet pub, a man approached SandFalls and nearly shouted at him, “SANDFALLS WHO R U”
Sand smirked and replied in a loud voice, “I AM RYDENS NEWEST ALT”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 43</a><div class="page-content">After the reply, the man calmed down and his tone lowered to a muttering of “Oh, I thought you were Shady planning to give Ryden a handjob up to Centauri…”
“Well, we aren’t ruling that out,” Sand grinned, glancing over to Ryden for a reaction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 43</a><div class="page-content">The other pursed his lips in surprise, but also to hold back his laughter as the drunken man nodded and mumbled about how it does get lonely on the rails.

 After they finished their drinks, they trudged back to the rails,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 43</a><div class="page-content">extremely sick of riding in a minecart for meters upon meters. Not to mention, dealing with the carts full of obsidian was getting tiresome. On they went, down the rails towards their final stop. 

 As they traveled along the dark rails side by side,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 43</a><div class="page-content">a question popped up in Ryden’s mind that he couldn’t shake away. He called out to SandFalls to get his attention before adding, “Hey, what you said back at the pub, were you joking or not?”
Sand smirked, “If it made you uncomfortable,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 43</a><div class="page-content">I was joking. If you’re interested, I was completely serious.”

 Ryden glanced down the rails behind them. They must have covered about 1k of rail and there was 2k remaining. Definitely enough time for something to ‘happen.’</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 43</a><div class="page-content">He cleared his throat, “Wanna be my new right-hand man?” Sand chuckled at the terrible joke and got out of his minecart to join Ryden in his.

 Sand sat in Ryden’s lap facing him and he leaned in to kiss the other, a hand slipping into his hair to tug</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"on it a bit. He tested the waters, rubbing Ryden’s thighs wondering what might get him hard. Soon, he was whispering in the other’s ear, his warm breath sending chills down Ryden’s body. Nips and nibbles really got him going and with some added "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"dirty talk, Rydenstrife’s sword was ready for swinging. As Sand began unbuttoning the other’s pants, he whispered into his ear, “Someday, I want to know all the places you love to be touched.” An audible hum came from Ryden, noting that he "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 43</a><div class="page-content">enjoyed the idea of future moments with his new lover. 

 A hand ventured into his pants, pulling out the mighty Excalibur. SandFalls distracted Ryden with another deep kiss, tongues darting out expectantly for each other.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"He placed his palm over the bottom of Ryden’s cock and began rubbing in a circular motion, just to get him started and fully erect. Already, the recipient was squirming in delight, soft moans and gasps emitting from him. Sand moved his mouth to Ryden’s"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 43</a><div class="page-content">neck, lips just barely touching, teasing his skin. 

 SandFalls began to stroke the erection with his fingers running all over the other’s cock. Ryden’s breath was still soft, the occasional grunt escaping him as Sand continued to tease</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"him. He was already seeping pre-cum, which Sand began rubbing all over the shaft. He began to work his way from the the tip of Ryden’s erection, massaging down to the base and repeating the process, using both hands. He could tell his simple movements"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 43</a><div class="page-content">were slowly building up the faster he did it and Ryden was begging him to go faster. “Mmm, faster?”
“Ah, god, yes. Please…”

 Sand switched up his hand movements pumping Ryden with both hands now, intent to make him cum soon since their stop was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"only 700 meters away. He tightened his grip and quickened his pace, causing Ryden to become louder and more urgent in his demands. He begged more and more until he grabbed the edges of the cart abruptly and his eyes shut tight. A loud moan dragged out "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"as his cock pumped out shots of semen onto Sand. He finished and felt much more exhausted than he should have, but he sat up and pulled the other down into a kiss. “Sorry about your shirt,” He mumbled to SandFalls, who seemed a lot less concerned"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 43</a><div class="page-content">than Ryden. He smirked and gave the leader a peck on the cheek. “Don’t worry about it, babe.”

 Sand pulled off his shirt and shoved it in his back pocket as they got out of their cart at Centauri. They kept glancing at each other the entire time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 43</a><div class="page-content">"they were unloading the chest carts, but both of them remained rather quiet. After they finished putting all the obsidian away, SandFalls pulled Ryden around the corner of a house and kissed him, pulling away slowly. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 43</a><div class="page-content">“Don’t be a stranger, okay?” He looked into Ryden’s eyes, “You owe me a return favor.”
Ryden’s smile became cocky, “I thought helping to move fuck loads of obbie was the favor and the handjob was the return favor from you.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 43</a><div class="page-content"> Sand pursed his lips realising, Ryden was sort of right. “Alright fine, but I’m still looking forward to seeing you again, alright?”
“How soon?”
“How about right now. My house.”
“You got it. Lead the way.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 43</a><div class="page-content">
