One night in a coffee house, a self-ordained Clay Zen Master said to him , "go to the dilapidated mansion on the Beach of Fellowship , more or less around 6107 -2644,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">you will find at this address which I have written down for you. Do not speak in chat to those who live there; you must remain AFK until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go to the large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the crouch position</div></div>

He did just as the Clay Zen Master instructed. His AFK’ing was frequently interrupted by worries. He worried</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how he would know when the moon rose on the next night. He worried about what the people  who walked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">through the room said about him in PMs to one another. His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, chicken droppings fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two people walked into the room...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The first asked the second who the man sitting there was. The second replied "Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead."

Hearing this, the Gerbil_8 was enlightened.</div></div>
