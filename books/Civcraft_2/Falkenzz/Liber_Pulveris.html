The Origin of Life
In the beginning there was nothing but the Cube and the Plains, no light, no water, no trees. The Cube spawned both mankind and deer. From His body the Cube blessed man with the means to support their own. Man hunted the deer for food</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and to please the Cube. Never did man waste but a round, for the Cube did bless them with sight. Life was well.
For eons the Cube gave and received, birthed and killed. The day came that a witch appeared on the Plains. The Witch demanded</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">complete control over the Plains and to take the freedom away from man. As almighty the Cube was, he drove the Witch away, for never to come back.
Though the Witch did come back, followed by its spawn.The spawn was fleshy and round of form,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">today only known as broodmothers. The man lined up for to use their hunting tools to remove these foul creatures form their Plains. Fiery follies were launched unto the hordes of fatty flesh. Though man fought brave and without mercy, the broodmothers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were too high of numbers to hold back. From the foul and repulsive birth-hole of the Witch fresh broodmothers rolled onto the Plains, now filled with corpses and craters. Man had to fall back for every thousand broodmothers</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">killed, there was no way to hold their lines.
The Plains were trampled and corpses piled up. From the streams of blood, rivers formed. From the bones, trees grew. From the hair, grass grew. From the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">lost tools, veins of metal were spread.
Man was still fighting bravely and with every step back, they fought fiercer. But for every step back the Plains were trampled, until the Plains were round like the evils it hosted. The last of man and the Cube</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">took off from the Plains, bitter by the loss of their way of life and world. The Cube and these brave men still look down to the Plains, enlighting the globe with their fiery hate for those who destroyed freedom.
Those brave men often descend</div></div>

On the first day of his labours, Kalashnikov drew many a design, yet could not find the right</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">one. He consulted with his Lordship, and the /k/ube said; "Yea wise Kalashnikov, thou shalt make a weapon of superior design: a weapon of steel and wood, of unparalleled reliability, of great stopping power. And thou shalt name it the Automat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Kalashnikov." With this holy vision in his head, great Kalashnikov set to work at once. And when his labours were done, he looked upon the great weapon he had built. And he saw that Murder/k/ube smiled upon his work, and so in the year of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">/k/ube 1947, he finalized his design.
Many years later, great Kalashnikov was called upon again to create a weapon to defend the Motherland. He prayed to the /k/ube: "Oh lord of operators, grant me your wisdom. Kebabs threaten</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">my precious Motherland, and I must help my comrades repel them." Hearing Kalashnikov's pleas, the /k/ube appeared to him, and said: "Wise Kalashnikov, have no fear. Your new weapon shall be much the same, but a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">new cartridge you shall chamber it in. A bullet of of 5.45mm in diameter, with a casing 39mm in length. Bakelite magazines shall load this cartridge into your weapon."With the /k/ube's blessings, Kalashnikov worked for 40 days and 40 nights until his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">design was done. And in the year of the /k/ube 1974, Kalashnikov delivered his new weapon to the Soviet Army, who removed many a kebab with it.
Then, For the removing of kebabs of future generations The Great Comrade</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Kalashnikov left his work to his son. Viktor Werked tirelessly to create a weapon of Kebab removal for the new conflicts that were to come.
But tragedy befell great Kalashnikov and his comrades! For the kebab, evil and scheming as they are, had AKs of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">their own. Kalashnikov prayed to Murder/k/ube that the enemy's weapons might fail, but to no avail. For the AK is blessed by his Lordship, and will not fail whomever wields it. For ten long years Kalashnikov and his comrades fought the evil kebab, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to no avail. In the year of the /k/ube 1991, great Kalashnikov's Motherland was shattered, and a new kind of kebab threatened Mother Russia. With the stampings of steel, and action of his fathers weapon he created the base. With a Magazine of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">helvetical he created a handguard. With the chamberings of Makarov he Created the brrrt. What was beholden next was a weapon of justice that the /k/ube blessed. "For the removal of Kebab is not just of rifles, and Karbines. But of total war and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Annihilation. Thus a weapon of the closeness of quarters was needed. And now it has been forged."
A kebab that struck from within! The evil of Chechnya had been contained in the days of Kalashnikov's Motherland. But with the Motherland</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">broken, the darkness of the Chechnyan kebabs rose once more. They sought to break Mother Russia further, and this caused Kalashnikov great distress. He prayed to the /k/ube once more: "Great Murder/k/ube, why hath thou forsaken me? Have I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">angered thee, have I not shown enough love to thine operators? Kebabs seek to destroy my homeland, and I beg thee now to bring us salvation!" His Lordship heard Kalashnikov's cries, and responded: "Very well, great</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Kalashnikov. You have shown wisdom and faith, and have never faltered from the way of the /k/ube. I shall grant your comrades great courage; they will fear no kebab. I shall grant your comrades great strength; they will overpower the</div></div>

I shall grant your comrades great accuracy; their bullets will bring down Chechnya. Thus I declare it, and thus it is so."With the power of the /k/ube in their hearts, Kalashnikov and his comrades struck down wicked Chechnya. And with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">/k/ube's blessing, Mother Russia was whole once more.
This is the account according to MauserWerke of our Glorious Comrade Gaston Glock. Many years had passed since the time of Comrade Browning. Under the Guidance of the Kube</div></div>

Special Operators were now on the forefronts, the world no longer desired a time in which followers of the kube removed in the open. The witch had drawn the powers into a time of</div></div>

In this time the weapons were required to be hidden, to be much lighter than that of our predecessors. For the operator to truly operate he must have the best.
