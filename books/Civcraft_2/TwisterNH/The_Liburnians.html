TwisterNH: A reformed griefer who is a libertarian. The self-appointed leader of the group, Twister is decent at PvP fighting and enjoys working for his wealth and trading. He established a small fort outside of the</div></div>

Biff193: Biff, who played as FrahdChickenz outside of Rome, is another ex-griefer and is Twister's right hand man. He is a communist, much as the tribe of Liburnia is within itself, and manages the farms. He enjoys</div></div>

Zowie321: Despite the strange username, Zowie is male. He is a decent miner, PvPer, just as active, but</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 10</a><div class="page-content">not as dedicated. He'll mine, but typically will just end up asking for supplies until the others reach their wits' end.

Youssef12345: A creationist Muslim, Youssef is a dedicated worker who will gather resources for the Liburnian cause</div></div>
