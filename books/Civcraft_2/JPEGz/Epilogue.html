I regretfully inform you that I am going to be leaving New Leningrad, this is in no way a reflection of my dislike for this glorious nation, or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 9</a><div class="page-content">anyone who is a part of it. 

This is why the decision was so hard to make, I have no ill wishes for NL, but I feel as though I made my decision as to where I should live too abruptly. Within minutes of first spawning I made my way to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Carbon, within which BolleDeBoll welcomed me with open arms.
He provided me with food and explained the basics of this strange land I had awoken in.
I was immediately in awe of him, standing in his glistening armour, describing a marvellous nation I soon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">came to know and love as New Leningrad.

I requested to join him and his cause, with which he provided me with a minecart and rail map, I immediately set off, eager to become a productive part of the society.

As soon as I arrived</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">I was lost amongst towering buildings that loomed overhead, and yet I never felt so free. 

I knew that NL had a great deal of history and I immediately began scouring all sources, old pictures fascinated me and I was hooked, the amount of work</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">put into the city was mind boggling to me and I just wanted to input to it, no matter how much of an input I wanted to be a part.

NL's heritage is what makes it truly great, entering a city and feeling part of something bigger is a feeling I will always</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">have when I visit here, it is overwhelming at times, especially when coupled with the comradery which makes even the newest member feel part of the Leninist family.

I have done my best to input into NL in any way I felt I could, I just hope you don't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">resent me for leaving.

And so I say my goodbyes, as I travel to start a new life in NDZ, hopefully to become more independent. I wouldn't exchange my experiences here for the world and it truly has been a blessing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Every single one of you are truly the most kind and welcoming people I have met in a long time, and I will endeavour to visit frequently.

Fairwell comrades,
