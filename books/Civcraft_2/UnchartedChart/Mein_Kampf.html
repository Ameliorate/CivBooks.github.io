<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The Diary of a Young Trans
By SalientGreen

Dedicated to all lost to transphobia and mental illness.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary.
Today I made a friend, this cave, after my spurious oppression at the hands of the cis-sexist Garundistani Regime, I made my way to the promised land, the cave of a kindly  lesbian feminist.
xe took me in and gave me food and hid me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">I hope one day the Garundistanis will learn to check their privilege, but untill then I will have to stay here lest they Pearl me for being trans.
I wish those cis-scum would just die. You and the kindly feminist are my only friends. I love you diary.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
Today I heard some players chatting nearby, I had to hide myself in order for them not to collect the bounty on my pearl by the cis-sexist Garundistani Regime.
I'm hoping that my suffering will bring a new age of tolerance and acceptance.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
The books my friend and benefactor lent me to subside my stay in this place are awful, the first and worst a book of fables probably written by a white man, are empty and lacking in wisdom, truly the patriarchal leaders are too stupid to rule.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">I honestly feel like I'm the only person in the world who actually gets it and can see the evil male cis-hetero hegemony and Garundistan wants me pearled because of my knowledge of their evil white male privileged ways.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
Today I made a new friend, they said they were chosen, and called me cute nicknames like "Shabbos Goy" and greeted me with "Shabbat Shalom" they asked me to give them something they called "shekels" so I gave them some gold and they left.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">They're truly my greatest ally.

Dear Diary,
I heard Garundistand calling feminism hate speech and claiming "Trannies are batshit" I was triggered as fuck, I mean ugh, just ugh, these people are the worst I hope they learn to stop oppressing us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary,
It's been ten days since I saw the sun, I think the GGers of Garundistan are coming for me, to silence my strong womxn voice. they're literally Haram, today I converted to islam, as it liberates me from the western tyranny.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
I hear the Garundistanis nearby, they're almost here.
I've not heard from my lesbian guardian in some time, I fear the worst and that  xe lies in a vault somewhere being violated by those cis-het rape culturists. I fear my time is short.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
It's happening, they're here
It was exactly as I feared, they broke in this morning, but I managed to escape them because white men are idiots.
I only hope my funny friend from earlier will take me in.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps I need to give them those "Shekels" they mentioned earlier. 
I pray to allah they will let me in and save me from the Garundistani patriarchal devils.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Dear Diary
They told me no, they called me a "Bad Goy" and turned me away. I only hope that I can escape... Allah Help me.

Allahu Akbar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Postscript, Sadly Salient was caught and pearled by the patriarchal oppressors of Garundistan. Salient was never able to transition into the beautiful human being they always hoped to be.

This book is dedicated to the memory of those lost to transphobia</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 15</a><div class="page-content">never again. remember the six million trans who have commited suicide or been killed because of their identity.</div></div>
