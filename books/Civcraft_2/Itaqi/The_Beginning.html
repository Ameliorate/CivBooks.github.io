As a founder of Orion, I was given the task to find a suitable location for Orion. I thought that the best way to do that was to visit the already established Eslenti and Ulaan Baatar.

My first visit was to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">Eslenti. I got there, after some troubles (I mixed up my coordinates.. -_-), I made it there and was greeted by belthazor, JM120897, and Puig19. They gave me some food in exchange for some Iron armor I found in an NPC village. I felt that the area around</div></div>

At Ulaan Baatar, I looked around for a bit and asked wadefrakers if there was a forest</div></div>

I, being a bit hasty, claimed that land for Orion, originally claiming a 400m radius from -4550, -5555. Myself and 555NY dug</div></div>
