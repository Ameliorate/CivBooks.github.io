<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 24</a><div class="page-content">In two months, I'll be going to be going essentially inactive, so I really want to make sure I leave New Senntisten as a better place than what it was when I came.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Here are a few of my ideas.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 24</a><div class="page-content">1) Let's give New Senntisten a brand. By our location, we're the defacto "Gateway to the North." We should push this identity. Positive identities like these are crucial to attracting visitors from across the world. Push the identity on the subreddit,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"forums, and other outside related avenues (mumble, city subreddit, outside subreddits, etc). "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"2) To be the Gateway to the North, we need to focus on constructing rail lines to anyone we can - nether and regular. Particularly, we should get working on the Hjaltland, Mount Augusta, and Thule lines to open our markets to more commerce. Multiple"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"rail connections are what kept Orion\u0027s market alive despite the city hollowing itself out. It was a travel huv. We need to be the hub of the North."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"3) Instead of forcing people to live in one place, like the Iron Forge, give prospective settlers options! NEWFRIENDS WANT AUTONOMY. Give them the ability to settle anywhere within our claims and it hits two birds with one stone. You attract more citizens"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">while boosting the legitimacy of your land claims. I CANNOT FURTHER STRESS HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS GOING FORWARD.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"4) However, the thing is, newfriends SUCK at getting productive things done alone. We need to do everything we can to empower them so they\u0027ll hit the ground running. I think it worked very well with Topher_Dobson, whom I gifted a ST pick, a bastion, a few"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"diamonds, and other miscelleanous building items. He\u0027s doing great, he\u0027s active, and a good model for what kind of citizens we should aim for. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"5) Another thing people like are access to markets. This is why I am pushing for bringing people to the Iron Forge Marketplace. If you know ANYONE that is REMOTELY interested in a shop plot, hit them up and let \u0027em know primm will pay them 20d and a"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">" snitch to build a shop in New Senntisten. I don\u0027t give a crap where they choose to build, as long as it\u0027s not in the immedtiate embassy and ministerial intersections, and they work within a reasonably sized plot for what they stock. This is another"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"example of how you can give people the AUTONOMY they want. People like looking at a bunch of plots and choosing, not being forced into one place. They will likely forego building a market at their home plot, colony, etc since our rail hub is meters from "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"our market. Trusted players, for example, frequent civcraftexchange users, can have more leeway in their plot sizes and locations. The only barriers we have are bastion access, which we should happily give out to new shop keepers."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">6) Newfriends are good "targets" for recruiting, but remember, the more friends we make, the better. The best people are often those that are settled elsewhere, but are willing to relocate with enough incentive. Citizens from dying cities are often</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">looking for lively, distinct, and growing cities. Plus they're less likely to leave after a week like a newfriend. Often, established players bring along their social network, which can help further expose the city to more eyes!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"7) Finally, people new to the area don\u0027t really know what\u0027s going on up here in the north. More than anything we need ensure we are MAINTAINING THE IDENTITY THAT A LOT IS GOING ON UP HERE. Think of Balkania back in the day - constant shitposts when in"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"reality, nothing really changed there for months. They stayed in the eye of everyone for a long time. How often were we there for POSITIVE reasons? Rarely. We can implement a visibility strategy, albeit in a much more mature fashion, like Mount Augusta"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 24</a><div class="page-content">back in Fall and Winter 2014.  I have a different methods to further this vision:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>I. Rewrite the outdated constitution. Do it in public, with public input. Maintain our image of transparency. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>II. Continue to promote our Iron Forge</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Marketplace as the Gateway to the North. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>III. Be friendly to our neighbors, old and new. They are the most likely to visit frequently, and thus, more likely to shop here, defend for us, and promote our cause.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"IV. Post images of ANY builds you have onto the subreddit so they can see TANGIBLE progress we\u0027re doing. I have found that images are easy to just see and upvote, which helps our visiblity. Group pics yield extra karma and construct a lively city identity"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 24</a><div class="page-content">V. Give newfriends the opportunity to construct their own towns in our lands through homesteading. People will enjoy competing for attention, which will be fuel for city dialogue. "My city is best in X in New Senntisten!" are the opinions we want to see.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 24</a><div class="page-content">"VI. Most importantly, ASSOCIATE YOURSELF AND YOUR POSTS TO NEW SENNTISTEN anywhere you post! How can people get the idea that people are from New Senntisten if they don\u0027t see anyone from there on the subreddit or forums?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 24</a><div class="page-content">I hope you enjoyed my plans. I am happy to hear criticism and suggestions. Let's do this!
