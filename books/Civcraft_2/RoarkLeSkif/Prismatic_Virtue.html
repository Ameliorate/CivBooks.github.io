<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 33</a><div class="page-content">   It can be said that the physical world around us is rather prismatic. Our world has no organic shapes or curves to it, only sharp corners and crystal clear divisions. I see no gradients in cobblestone.
   So why then do we not hold ourselves to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 33</a><div class="page-content">the same standard? By this I mean that in order to live in this world we should assume the world's essence of being perfectly clear cut and rigidly defined. We should be living PRISMatically.
   PRISM is an acronym I devised to easily remember the five</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 33</a><div class="page-content">simple virtues of life in this blocky world. They are each of equal importance and are:

Peace
Responsibility
Integrity
Sympathy
Maturity</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">   In each chapter of this book we will be taking an in-depth look at these virtues and why they're important.     So without further ado, let us begin with the first letter in the PRISM acronym, the virtue of Peace.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content">          PEACE

   "If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."  
        -Miner Theresa

   Peace is defined as freedom from disturbance. This means that peace is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">not only an inner state but also affected by outside forces. To attain peacefulness you need to only be at peace with yourself but also with others.       Being free from disturbances is crucial in this world. We have much to focus on with building and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 33</a><div class="page-content">molding the world to our desires. To have someone come along and destroy our creation is greatly harmful to our own well-being and peace of mind. Thus, assume an attitude of peace in all that you do, so that those around you can focus on what's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 33</a><div class="page-content">important in this world. And when you declare peace towards others, it gives you more time to focus on what's really important to you.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">    RESPONSIBILITY

   "Responsibility is the price of freedom."
     -Elbert Hubbard

   To be responsible is to have a duty to someone or something. Each of us is responsible for multiple things every day, especially when</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">living in close proximity to others. There's responsibilities to yourself to be safe and eat each day, but there's also responsibilities to each other that are not so easily seen or understood. 
   First, we must be responsible for our actions towards</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">each other. In this regard, telling the truth is always vital. If you have wronged someone you have a responsibility to answer to them for your wrongdoings. 
   There is also the responsibility to help your neighbor. This means not only doing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">no harm towards your neighbor but also actively doing good. By doing good you are improving your neighbor's life, which in turn improves your own. By improving the well-being of those around you, you improve your own situation.
   Finally, there is a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 33</a><div class="page-content">responsibility to not only help your neighbor but also listen to their opinion.
A community which cannot listen to each other cannot grow together. Everyone must have a fair say, and their voice cannot be allowed to be drowned out by those more powerful</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">or influential than they are. This ensures a thriving community in which the minority still gets heard, and if the minority happens to be correct about some subject or other, than the truth shall find its way into the mind of society as a whole.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">        INTEGRITY

   "Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind."  -Ralph Waldo
          Emerstone

   Integrity not only means being honest and having strong moral principles, it also is a state of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">being whole and undivided. It is in this manner with which I use Integrity. 
   Be undivided in your beliefs like the squares of stone are undivided in the walls of your home. Do not allow cognitive dissonance to find a root inside your mind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">This is not to say that you should close yourself off from accepting new beliefs, but merely to say that you must come up with a coherent world view that does not allow for conflict. Do not believe one thing and do another.
   As always there will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">be new opinions that may change your worldview or cause your beliefs to shift. That is okay. What is not okay is lying to yourself that you have the world figured out when in fact your own beliefs are not even in accordance with each other. If</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">your beliefs cannot agree with each other, then they also cannot agree with the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">        SYMPATHY

   "The more sympathy you give, the less you need."
      -Malcolm Forbes

   Most people think of sympathy as pity but it also means an understanding between people, or a common feeling. Sympathy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">gives us the ability to put ourselves in another's shoes and come to understand their viewpoint. In turn this allows us to also better see our own viewpoints through the glass of someone else's eyes. 
   Always be sympathetic towards other's viewpoints.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Give each other the benefit of the doubt when in a disagreement. Even if you think that they must be crazy, try and see where they're coming from. You don't have to give in to their viewpoint or compromise, but rather make an effort to fully</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">understand their position. Then if you still think that you are in the right you can go about trying to change their viewpoint, this time in a much more effective way than before. By seeing where they're coming from you may also happen to see where</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">they are making an error in judgment and hopefully by showing them this they will be sympathetic and listen to your reasoning. Both parties can make it out better than one if they remain sympathetic towards each other.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">        MATURITY

   "Maturity is knowing when to be immature."
        -Randall Hall

   Maturity means more than being fully developed physically, it's also synonymous with being sensible, levelheaded, and even reliable. We're called</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">to be mature in our interactions with each other and to not let emotions get the better of us. By letting our rationality take charge in our interactions we can protect each other from mental or emotional harm. By turning away from name-calling and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">focusing on more important and intelligent methods of debate we can get to the heart of the matter faster. Being mature greases the wheels of society to allow it to move at an accelerated rate.
   Being mature is not a death centence to fun. We are, after</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">all, only in this world to have fun. But fun should not be had at another's expense. It is more desirable to share fun with others than to push people down so that you can have a little bit of it. And there's also oppurtune moments to be immature, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">important thing is knowing when those moments are.
   Being mature is not asking you to remove your emotions from your being. It's merely asking you to keep them subdued when dealing with others, especially those you may not care for. Maturity is a virtue</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">that can be difficult to understand and use properly, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying to do so. Being mature can give you more benefits than being immature, and by being mature you will know when it's okay to let loose and have a little fun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 33</a><div class="page-content">   In conclusion, I ask you to consider these five virtues and their application in your life. If every man woman and child abided by these virtues I feel we would all be much better off than we are today. The PRISMatic virtues are for everyone, for the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 33</a><div class="page-content">benefit of everyone, so go and live the way this prismatic world asks us to. 

   As always, thanks for reading. :)
