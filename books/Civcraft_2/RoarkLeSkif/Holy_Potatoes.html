   I found myself heading to Little Latvia for the third time in a month, this time to restock my bar. I had recently purchased some land in LL's market district and had opened a bar, using the Swisston Brewing Co. to stock it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 49</a><div class="page-content">I had never been back since opening, but I had gotten a tip from an LL resident that my bar had completely run out of brews.
   This was even more shocking to me because the prices I charged in LL were significantly higher than in New Danzilona.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 49</a><div class="page-content">I did this because I had assumed that people in Little Latvia had no use for gold nuggets, unlike Danzilonans, and also thought charging a moderate delivery fee would be a good idea so I wouldn't have to restock it very often.
   Obviously I was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 49</a><div class="page-content">wrong. I secretly hoped this wasn't just a single person buying the brews for the novelty but rather a steady stream of customers trying each brew out individually. I needed the revenue stream to support my hockey team.
   The trip to Little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Latvia begins on the rails to Churchill. The location of the railway from NDZ to Churchill is secret, and I always feel like James Bond whenever I make the trip. Finding it is like an adventure in itself.
   The people of Churchill are wary of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 49</a><div class="page-content">strangers, as I found out on my first day in the town way back when DarkFlame was making a hockey rink. I had arrived to inspect their rink and also play an exhibition game, teaching the Grizzlies how to play. Anyways, that was a long time ago and not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 49</a><div class="page-content">relevant to this trip.
   The rail becomes significantly more refined as you go. What starts as a cave passageway becomes a stone brick hallway with ornate fences lining the walls. Eventually you find yourself in the Churchill Rail Station,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 49</a><div class="page-content">a modern engineering marvel.
   The station is made of brick and smooth stone, and it's incredibly easy to get lost. It's almost absurd how big it is considering how few visitors Churchill gets, but perhaps they're preparing for something. The room</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 49</a><div class="page-content">you enter after leaving the rails is lined with benches in a Grand Hall of sorts, presumably where passengers would wait on their train. I can't say I've ever seen anyone in there though. 
   After the Grand Waiting Room, you go through a tunnel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 49</a><div class="page-content">which spits you out on the north side of Churchill. Wooden fence lamp posts adorn the smooth stone streets and as you go a little farther south the Churchill Clocktower comes into view. 
   The Clocktower is another incredible building feat by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 49</a><div class="page-content">residents of Churchill. It towers over the houses, a skyscraper in its own right, displaying 3 o' clock with giant wool block hands.
   But I was here on business, not sight-seeing. I hurried past the Clocktower and continued south, past hosue after</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 49</a><div class="page-content">house. Eventually I came to a large wheat farm and a gravel path that branched off to the west, and I knew this to be the road to Little Latvia, the younger and smaller of the Sister Cities.
   The first building that comes up once you enter Little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Latvia is the Church of the Holy Potato. The residents of LL are rather fond of potatoes I've learned, calling them, "the impossible dream." Whether by accident or on purpose, the church resembles a giant barn, made out of red brick. Nearby they have a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 49</a><div class="page-content">tremendous potato farm, laid out in a diamond on the ground. There's even a stone cross raised up in the middle of it, preaching the faith of the Holy Potato.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2

   The architecture in LL is quite different from that of Churchill. Where as Churchill has an organic feel, with winding roads and quaint houses, LL is rather square and organized. Roads lie in straight lines and gray cold buildings</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 49</a><div class="page-content">rise straight up into the air. Vines cover most of these skyscrapers to break up the monotony. 
   That's not to say the buildings aren't impressive. Each one is bigger than the last, with multiple stories all filled with something. One's a museum,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 49</a><div class="page-content">another an art gallery. One floor is a theatre, the next is a radio station.
   They still kept an old relic from their past, the LL Farmhouse. Amidst all the inorganic glass and stone it sits quietly at the base of a mountain surrounded by fountains and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 49</a><div class="page-content">flowers. I was told it was the first building ever constructed in Little Latvia, and it's a nice homage to where they came from.
   Past the farmhouse you come to see the wide river that Little Latvia butts up against, and the buildings begin to get</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 49</a><div class="page-content">smaller and smaller. The houses of the residents here are modest, and between most of them are green patches of trees and flowers, which adds a real element of beauty to the stone brick surrounding you. Not farther past is more grass, until you hit</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 49</a><div class="page-content">the immense countryside Little Latvia owns. Out in the country are homesteads of LL residents, each with their own large mansions and farms. But for this trip I stayed near the river, in the newly made Little Latvia marketplace.</div></div>

   After a good night's sleep I tended to my store, restocking as I needed. I had brought plenty of brews from the Swisston Brewing Company and discovered I had left a few in my torage chest in my upstairs apartment above the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 49</a><div class="page-content">bar. My tip had been accurate, I was completely cleaned out of beer. I collected my stack of gold nuggets and restocked more than I had put in before, check ed to make sure the doors were locked to my apartment and headed out, exploring the new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 49</a><div class="page-content">developments along the river nearby.
   A few blocks from my own bar was a bar with Little Latvia's flag on it, ran by a local. I checked his prices and saw he was selling the same brews as me but for iron rather than gold. That was good, we were not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 49</a><div class="page-content">so much competitiors as we were simply businesses accepting different foreign currencies. I also noticed that the owner had netherwart growing above his bar, an idea I'm ashamed I didn't think of. So far I had been traveling all the way to Trackistan</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 49</a><div class="page-content">to stock up on netherwart, when I could be growing it right at home. Unfortunately I didn't save any soul sand from this trips and if I wanted to start a netherwart farm I would have to go back and acquire some.
   Little Latvia uses a lot more wood than</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 49</a><div class="page-content">what I would be comfortable with, but it makes sense. Griefers are rare this far out in the country, and they don't have fears of lava dumping as much as we do in NDZ. Their stables near the market are a testament to this, made entirely out of wood. I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 49</a><div class="page-content">cringe a little thinking how much damage a creative griefer with a flint and steel could do, but then again I'm reminded that it's likely not something that crosses a Little Latvian's mind. They remain untroubled by griefers, and I envy them for that.</div></div>

   Before leaving Little Latvia, I wanted to stop by a few more sights, the first being the Seven Peaks Ice House: Home of the LL Grizzlies. I was curious to see if anything had changed since our regular season exhibition</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 49</a><div class="page-content">game not so long ago.
   The hike up is treacherous, a winding cobblestone staircase as you climb a literal mountain, but once your each the top you have a tremendous view of the town below. There's also an immense bridge which leads across the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 49</a><div class="page-content">river to the ice rink, and as you walk along you can even see another bridge just like it half a kilometer to the north.
   The rink hadn't changed much, although I did see a new viewing area built above one of the goal ends that hadn't previously been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 49</a><div class="page-content">there. Sneaking up to it I saw the view it offered, which was rather modest but still nice, and I imagined what it would look like if a game were going on beneath me. The floor was made of glass rather cleverly, allowing the patron to sit farther up the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 49</a><div class="page-content">rink until they were almost over the goal, and still be able to look directly below them if the action moved to their side. I was sure to take note of this for a future expansion to the Spade VIP Lounge in the Swisston Rink, and then proceeded to leave.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 49</a><div class="page-content">   Going back down the stairs is much more frightening than going up, as you have no guide rail to support you if you fall and you can see the tops of skyscrapers below you. Skyscrapers that until just recently seemed to touch the sky now dwarfed in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 49</a><div class="page-content">comparison to your own elevation.
   The last stop of my journey I vaguely remembered from one of my visits in Little Latvia, and it took me awhile wandering the streets to find it again: The Little Latvia Heritage Tower.
   One of the tallest</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 49</a><div class="page-content">buildings in Little Latvia's Central District, it boasted seven floors which had a dance floor, a theater, a patio, and a grand balcony where you could just make out Churchill on the horizon. Unfortunately and to my dismay, I discovered that the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 49</a><div class="page-content">doors leading up had been locked since my last visit, and the area was closed to visitors.
   Undeterred to see some Little Latvian culture, I found an unlabeled building nearby which I believed to be the Little Latvia museum. After the first few</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 49</a><div class="page-content">floors of offices and desks I came to a floor labeled, "Modern History," with one sole exhibit on display: The Lenning. The sign above it read that it was the server's first paper currency.
   The next anf final floor of the museum was labeled, "Little</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 49</a><div class="page-content">Latvian History," and similarly only had one item on display: The first potato grown in Little Latvia. It rested safely behind glass on a block of glowstone, forever illuminated like an undying flame. A sign told me that it was presented to DarkFlame, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 49</a><div class="page-content">founder, by a player named CBakon. Another sign next to it read, "Is seed of God." I smiled and stared in wonder, trying to conjure up the same feelings I assume all Little Latvians feel when they gaze upon a vegetable grown underground. After a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 49</a><div class="page-content">brief moment of silent reflection I left the museum, homeward bound.
   On my way out of Little Latvia, I stopped by the Church of the Holy Potato for a second time, taking closer inspection. I found an unlocked door which led to a Communion Room,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 49</a><div class="page-content">where I found chests which I can only presume were full of potatoes. Returning the main hall, I walked past the pews to the front where a pulpit made of brilliant white quartz was. behind it I found a Communion Chest which was unlocked but to my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 49</a><div class="page-content">disppointment contained no potatoes either. Suddenly I heard a soft mewing nearby and noticed there was a cat sitting next to the pulpit obediently. I cracked another smile; these trusting Little Latvians. They had left their cat here alone,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 49</a><div class="page-content">probably iwthout even thinking twice, knowing no harm would come to it. I bent over and petted its head while it purred softly. Truly this was a different culture.</div></div>

   On the trip back I was forced to sit and reflect on my journey to LL and how it'd been profitable in more ways than one. I was astonished that I was the only one there, with no residents within earshot, and that I had been able to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 49</a><div class="page-content">access all that I had been able to. I was able to peer into houses and public buildings, look at objects of great value with out so much as a block preventing me from taking it. Little Latvia is a small trusting town with friendly residents, at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 49</a><div class="page-content">least once they get to know you.
