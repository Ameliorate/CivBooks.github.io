   I woke up in an unfamiliar place. It was flat and dark and no one called back at my calls. At the time of writing this journal I have since left that place, but there were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">desolate buildings all around. Walls of cobblestone with holes big enough to fit through. Then, a voice called out.
   His name was Chef Asdoi. He told me he was a newcomer like me who had found civilization. Apparently he had been attacked but a person</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">stepped in and killed the criminal. It sounded like a safe enough place so I set out to find it.
   After a few mistakes in directions I found the Commonwealth. It's more massive than I can even believe. There most be hundreds of people living here. What</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">a community. I can't wait to see what the next few days have in store for me.

   Saka NoYou has given me a temporary house. He's the stranger that helped Chef Asdoi and he seems nice enough. He gave me plenty of materials to start</div></div>

I asked him how much a plot of land cost and he told me that land was free in the Commonwealth. You just had to show that you were worthy of owning it. I set out to gather sand for another town"</div></div>

   Just made a few rounds of the city to try and get my bearings. It's so easy to get lost around here. I only explored two burroughs and that seemed like too much of it. Ironside is</div></div>

   Concord seems to be the high class burrough, with tall buildings and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">beautiful scenery. I saw a monument for a Lazuli War in 2012; I'll have to ask what that was all about. 
    The exit out of Concord leads straight to water which will be great for fishing. I also managed to find two squid which helped me finish the</div></div>

   Just got done doing some destruction work for Rykleos, a new person I just met. he seems to have some influence in the town.

   Today I set out to</div></div>

I started by mining to try and find iron to craft a minecart, but instead found clay and coal which I was able to trade with tomutwit.      Following this trade Tom gave me directions to the train station and instructions on "</div></div>

I'm currently riding the subway as I write this out, and I sure hope I'm not missing any important signs by doing so. I seem to be going an awful long distance now without stopping.

   I've arrived in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Carson. I met a townsperson who has helped me find the next connecting train line. It seems I must take the yellow line east and connect from there. The people so far in this world have been friendly. I hope I never meet an unfriendly one.

I\u0027ve never been in a more confusing place it seems. I left the Commonwealth precisely for that reason.

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">staircases. My hope is that New Danzilona will be much simpler.

   The click clack of my cart wheels is soothing in a strange way. I don't feel nervous about entering a new unfamiliar place. I started in one yesterday and it turned out quite</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"all right for me. The one thing I can\u0027t get out of my head is reading earlier about drama and war that had been going on in New Danzilona. Something about Moraco causing problems with no foreseeable end in sight. I certainly hope it\u0027s not as bad as "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"it sounds. For all the confusion of the Commonwealth it did have safety on its side. A big place like that is hard to get around in I imagine. Any griefer would have a hard time finding me cooped up in my little room amidst towering megabuildings. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It made me feel like a needle in a haystack.

   It might be helpful to list my inventory at the current moment, sailing along these rails. I have with me a bed, given to me by SakaNoYou, wood, an ample amount of cobblestone, a modest amount of coal I</div></div>

   I stopped in Carbon for a brief instance (boy, it's hard to keep</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"those two towns apart in my head) and I ran into Chef Asdoi! I was baffled that he happened to be so far away from where we both had started. He told me he was fishing here and was going to open up a fishing shop. Strange that just yesterday we "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were in such similar circumstances and in 24 hours fate has driven us on completely separate paths.

   By my calculations I am now over 6 kilometers away from the Commonwealth, and still have not even reached Mt. Augusta</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">yet. This world is on a gigantic scale I can't comprehend. Without this railway I would have given up on finding Danzilona a long time ago.
***
   I arrived in Mt. Augusta and no one answered my call. It seems my next stop is Holy Tree and then</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">after that I should be in New Danzilona. Here's hoping.

   A man named Bountytech just called out to see if anyone is on. Given his semi-threatening name I didn't respond, hoping to avoid any conflict. While my supplies may be</div></div>

   I have reached Holy Tree and the sign in the station indicates that the next stop is New Danzilona. I'm eager now to see if it's what I imagine. 
   I've decided I can</div></div>

   I came up to a station without a stop and decided to hop out and inspect to make sure I wasn't passing through new Danzilona.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It wasn't, instead it was a place called Stoneburrow, which i take is very deep under the Earth by the looks of it.

   I've made it to New Danzolina and there's been so much going on that I haven't had a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">chance to put it all down on paper. First, when I arrived no one was here. I did some exploring, got the lay of the land and it's almost exactly how I imagined it. Fields of wheat carry on farther than the eye can see and it even has a public library!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">   Anyways, much later I finally got someone high up in the town to give me a plot of land, which I only just finished creating. My first real house! It's simple and bland, but it has a nice field next to it protected by fences and a bed upstairs.

   Today I started by collecting wheat and making hay bales for the front of my house. I now have a nice little stack sitting on the corner, available to anyone who wants to grab some extra wheat. Three loaves of bread can be made</div></div>

   I've been in active discussions in the past day over citizenship in New Danzilona. Today is election day and I was sure to question two of the candidates how they defined citizenship in their eyes. Both of them said they wanted to</div></div>

   I went exploring across the wilderness and came across a sheep! I dyed his wool brown and have begun calling him, "Brownie." After leading him all the way back home I was able to get him inside safely.</div></div>
