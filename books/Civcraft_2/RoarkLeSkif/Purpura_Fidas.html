<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The Book of Poniceus
#####
   In the beginning, Poniceus created everything. But he quickly realized that purple was the best color for everything so he began making everything purple. The entire world was bathed a soft violet hue, and life was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">good.
   However, people began questioning this monochromatic scheme Poniceus had made. They wondered if perhaps two colors might be better than one. So in an act of defiance, people began splitting Poniceus' beautiful creation into two colors, red and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">blue. Those who wanted more red in the world became known as the Rojas, and those who wanted more blue were the Azulas.
   Poniceus, devoid of his perfect creation, passed on to another astral plane where he was free to stare at purple forever. He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">called this plane Purpura, and has lived there ever since.

The Book of Armentis

   Eventually, as teh world divided itself further along the red and blue lines, a man by the name of Armentis came along. He saw the flaws with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">"both colors; Rojas were concerned too much so with the mind and intelligence, while Azulas were focused far too much on aesthetics and beauty. This was shown by the blocks the two opposing hues had taken to represent themselves, Redstone and Lapis Lazuli."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">   One day, Armentis received a vision from Poniceus who reached out across the astral plane divide. Poniceus said unto Armentis,
   "Bro, these people are crazy. Why focus on one thing or the other? Just combine the two of them and you'll be better off</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">than both of them, dummy."
   So Armentis set out that day to combine the two conflicting ideals, of art and intelligence, and was persecuted far and wide for his actions. He would be kicked out of towns for showing off purple blocks he had made using</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">both the factions' blocks. He was beat up on occasion when he preached that people should be concerned with both aspects of life rather than just one. And on one occasion, he was mugged for trying to spray paint a cat purple.
   But Armentis did</div></div>

He died at the ripe old age of 24 when he tried to show that purple was better by ingesting purple blocks for a week straight.

The Book of Purprism

   Poniceus still lives in his astral plane of Purpura, waiting one day to return to a purple world and be crowned king of the Purple Realm. As followers of Poniceus, we choose to live out his instructions to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Armentis and spread purple blocks all over the world, as well as what they represent.
   We strive to further not only our practical intelligence, but also our aesthetic awareness. Culture and science blended together in a perfect grape slushie. The kind</div></div>

   Followers will abide by Armentis' way</div></div>

Purprism is dedicated to painting the world purple, but only by getting everyone on board first.

The Book of Pureign

   One day, once the world is covered in purple, Poniceus will return. This day is known as Pureign. There will be dancing and fanfare, singing and nachos. Poniceus</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">"will award his most devote followers each with their own purple capes and crowns.
