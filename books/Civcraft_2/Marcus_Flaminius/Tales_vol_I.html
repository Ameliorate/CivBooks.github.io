      A compilation
     of his sayings
     from sometime
     in the summer
        of 2012.



          April
          2013</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   As you may know, Sheeple aren't the fastest of the Civcraft races. But for, what, 3 minutes...
I was incredible...
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    I was able to clear distances with such speed! Such Grace!
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    "A fast Sherson? Incredible!" A fast Sherson, you might ask.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    Indeed I was fast... very fast. But I slowly started to... slow. I could feel myself... dying...
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    This was a bit before I fully understood english, "Bahhhhh!!!", I said. But, as the Pigmen were to me, I was to the People... An abomination...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 11</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    I slowly regained my balance, and floricked back to Columbia, forever changed. I got some blaze rods off of jacejace... for "potions".
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    I developed a might lab in my basement. Not far from my developing cow herd. <span class="fmtcode">§r</span> <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    Anyway, I started</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 11</a><div class="page-content">developing these warts... warts local only to the nether. And I put them in water... Awkward, I know. But, I put sugar in as well. And that's when I got it.
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    Speed. Not the speed the Nether Abominations gave me though. It was a shorter high...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">much more intense, though. My speed was only seconded to those cruel beings, Endermen.
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    "Jack's Special Shit" I called it. I could have thought of a better name, but I think it was the Speed talking. This potion...
this poison... made me
feel great!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    I could run circles around any human. After every minute, though... it ended, and so came the gut-wrenching pain.
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    During this moment of pain, I could not scream. What I could do, though, was speak my own language. A dead language now,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">that even I forget at points. Sherplish...
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>    Many mock it. Sheep are often misunder-
stood. "Bahhhh" is not our restriction.

I have to go, though...</div></div>
