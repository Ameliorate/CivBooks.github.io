<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 22</a><div class="page-content">In the name of Catta, the merciful, the compassionate.

Praise be to Catta, Lord of this world. Master of all of Civcraft. 

Guide me in the path of your will, Catta.

Catta's prayer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Catism is made up of 5 cores all followers must follow to call themselves Catist.
1. Peace
2. Altruism
3. Zacat.
4. Forgiveness
5. Loyalty to Catta.

The Five cores will be
explained later.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Just What is Catism?

Catism is the belief that Catta is the Lord of Civcraft and it's creator and Cattus_
is his prophet. Catist believe that humankind has been corrupted by greed and hate. Catist attempt to remove greed and hate by speading Catism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Once all follow the five cores Civcraft will reach a end game utopia. 

So do you guys like worship cats lol?

In a way yes. Catta the creator, is a Cat and all Cats are made in his image. Cats were made before humankind.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The Cats have been corrupted by the negative qualities Catta gave humans. Corrupted Cats are known as Ocelots. Ocelots can be made pure and holy again by feeding holy fish. Holy fish is fish that has been cleaned and blessed in a Catist temple.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Why did Catta give humans negative qualities? Why doesn't he just change Cats back to normal as well?

Catta gave humans negative qualities like hate and greed to keep from getting to powerful, but instead the negative qualities
took over and made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 22</a><div class="page-content">the world full of suffering we have today. Catta doesn't want to see in this sad state and sent Cattus_ to spread his will that will slove all suffering. Catta would have fixed the suffering of the world, but because he gave humankind total freewill,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 22</a><div class="page-content">humankind will have to fix the world them selves. 
The Holy Cats can't be changed back because becoming one with Catta is a personal journey that must be done within oneself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 22</a><div class="page-content">     The Five Cores
     Of Catism.
1. Peace.
 Catta created us all equally so to wage war or murder others is wrong. However, the Catist must be ready to defend himself from the corrupted. The corrupted of course those controlled by negative qualities.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 22</a><div class="page-content">2. Altruism.
The Catist must care about those around them and their community. Selfishness is a quality of the corrupted, not the Catist. Hoarding large amounts of wealth is slefish. Catists must care for all their brothers and sisters, even if they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Are not Catist.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">3. Zacat.
Zacat is the act of giving to those around the Catist, including the less fortunate. Zacat is not a special date, but rather lasts all year. It is very important for a Catist to practice Zacat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">4. Forgiveness
Catist must be willing to extend the paw of forgiveness to all those who accept it. If someone has wronged the Catist the Catist must forgive them. If the wrong do-er rejects the paw of forgiveness and attacks the Catist, the Catist must</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">defend themselves. Self defense is always allowed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">5. Loyalty To Catta.
Catta calls for loyalty to himself and for all to follow his will. It is important to note that Catta does not punish those who disobey him. Catta gave humankind free will. Catta wants to see the best for human kind and has thus given</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">humans a plan for a utopian world, and they are know as the five cores of Catism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">  The Rose is the perfect metaphor for Catism.

The green stem is the path to living a non-corrupted lifestyle. On the stem are thorns. The thorns are the corrupted and those who will try to stray you from reaching the Flower.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">The flower or red part of the rose is a non-corrupted lifestyle. One must travel down the stem and overcome the thorns to reach the flower.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 22</a><div class="page-content">Want to be a Catist? Great, just follow Catta and the five cores and build a temple in your local community. One does not have to ask to be a Catist. 
If you would like like to reach other Catist msg Cattuscat on reddit or Cattus_ in game.</div></div>
