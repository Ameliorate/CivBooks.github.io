-------------------

Before you can go around properly disposing of heretics, you have to know how to spot them, and that means knowing what heresy and heretics are and how they are different from you or</div></div>

"the denial of a revealed truth of the Roman Orthodox Muslim Church". If</div></div>

Some of these key tenets that the person "</div></div>

1.) The Old Testament is the very foundation from which all law must be built from.
2.) God is actually three seperate but unified spirits who was reborn atleast five times as Jesus, Muhammad, Moses, Abraham, and Emporer Constantine.</div></div>

A heretic will sternly reject these truths as falsehoods and claim other truths contrary to these.</div></div>

-------------------

Now that you know what heresy looks like you need to know how to make sure that you have seen it in suspected heretics. One common method of testing for heresy is a trial by fire; light a</div></div>

If the person burns to death, they were a heretic as God would have saved them from the flames if they were a true believer. Another method is to force the individual to eat spider eyes, if they become poisoned they are a</div></div>

The simplest way may be to give the individual a quick smack with a blessed golden sword. These can be obtain by from the Pope or one of his cardinals.
Heretics most commonly are</div></div>

-------------------

Now that you've found a heretic, you need to know what to do next. Firstly, be absolutely certain the Pope receives word or your discovery, one heretic in a group most likely means that more are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">in the very same group. Next, acquire an appropriate sized force to subdue the heretic. If possible, contact a member of the Order of the Dragon, the law arm of the papacy, and have them accompany you to the heretics whereabouts. Try to take the heretic</div></div>

If the heretic is captured alive, then they are to be put on a large pyre and set ablaze. The fire purifies the soul as it</div></div>

By doing this you are not only saving the earth from the heretic but saving the heretic from themself. If a fire cannot be built, putting the heretic to the sword in God's name will suffice as well.</div></div>
