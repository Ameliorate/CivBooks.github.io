I exited the portal and went to my house only to find one of my chests broken. I checked the snitch log. The person who did it was pearled. Whatever, no valuables in the chest. I got my things and"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">headed for the portal. I went through only to find it blocked. There was no way out.

I had just been there not five minutes ago.

I logged out and waited a few minutes. Logged back in and it was unblocked, it seems that RyanRolls</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">had taken the liberty of picking away the obsidian that covered the portal. The HCF "ceasefire" was enacted, so I had no fear of traveling on the nether roads.

However, BraandanJames sprinted to my position...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">He took out an enchanted bow and aimed it at me. For some reason he put the bow away and threw and ender pearl at me, at which point I promptly logged out...

I talked with him later and it seems that I am on an HCF kill list. The reason?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">"I defended Augusta from Rattlertank when not many would. I was one of the only not to die during the battle.I was one of the more cautious ones. However, this had since been resolved. Rattlertank (MrTwiggy) was pearled for his actions. It seems odd they"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">would still go after me for it.

I waited at the spot braandanjames attempted to kill me at for 3 days, playing civtest and doing other things.

When I logged on I ran into Augusta only to find camxd standing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">right in front of me.

He was AFK so he didn't see me.

However, I paniced and booked it out of town to my keep 3000m away. It is there I stay until this blows over...</div></div>

He was one of the guys who attacked Augusta with Rattlertank. Good for mister_magpie, but he\u0027s only under a 4 layer DRO vault. Some of the AnCaps are going to look to transfer the pearl to a bigger vault."</div></div>

They distracted captin_milky by sending him to Jacks Hold, the old city. It seems that camxd didn\u0027t log on for a second while they were moving his pearl, so they had no way to find the pearl."</div></div>

The HCF have dispersed, their vault has been broken. It is unclear who "won" or "lost" the war, but us warriors of civcraft</div></div>
