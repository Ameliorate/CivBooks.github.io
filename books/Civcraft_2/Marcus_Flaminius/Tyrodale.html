  CHAPTER 1:   My name is Eyriin, I currently am living in Tyrodale, the town with recent... Well.. no other way to say it, murder activites.  I decided that I should tell my cousin Iradessa, even if she won't believe me!  Time and Time again I think how</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">smart these murderers have been.  It's truly scary , still, I head out with my dear friend Magnolia who says her brother went after them. As we pass through the dead tree filled forest I can't stop the feeling I am being watched suddenly, out of the</div></div>

  CHAPTER 2:   Blood. We have gone by a cave which had blood leading</div></div>

As we go into the cave a thunder storm begins to start. It echoes through the cave. Magnolia, Iradessa, and I fall down a steep rock slide in the cave. Magnolia is hurt,</div></div>

I slowly crept near the noise slowly drawing my bow. I recognize who is making the noise it is Magnolia's brother, he has been hurt and was groaning. I wal kto him and ask why</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">hadn't he come back to Tyrodale. His answer is weak and he tells me that the murderers had been cooped up here. He then asks if anyone came with me, and I say in return, 'My cousin and your sister.'

In response I say 'of 'course I did, the fell and were hurt, they asked me to go on. was there anything I should've worried about?' He stares at me blankly as if he were petrified, then he begins to cry. I ask him why he</div></div>
