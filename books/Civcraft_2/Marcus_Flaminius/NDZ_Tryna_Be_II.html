   Today I started by collecting wheat and making hay bales for the front of my house. I now have a nice little stack sitting on the corner, available to anyone who wants to grab some extra wheat. Three loaves of bread can be made</div></div>

   I've been in active discussions in the past day over citizenship in New Danzilona. Today is election day and I was sure to question two of the candidates how they defined citizenship in their eyes. Both of them said they wanted to</div></div>

   I went exploring across the wilderness and came across a sheep! I dyed his wool brown and have begun calling him, "Brownie." After leading him all the way back home I was able to get him inside safely.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">   I need to ask around and see if anyone is wlling to begin an animal breeding program. I'd like a good stock of pigs and cows as well, arguably the more useful of the farm animals.

   I've discovered a massive farming</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">operation to the northwest of town. It's got water pumps creating an auto-farm of sorts. The only problem I see is after each use you have to replant it all by hand. But that's a small price to pay for a well-constructed auto-farm. My rinky</div></div>

   I just finished rebuilding my house. Now I have a porch and an animal pen beneath it. It keeps Brownie safe and he has plenty of hay</div></div>

    Just made a trade with Edward from DPNCCR. I found a bunch of clay while mining and was able to trade almost two</div></div>

   Today I started by going down to the mine and boy was it worth it! I found a cave</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 24</a><div class="page-content">spider den are quickly eradicated it, taking all the precious string with me. I even found some gold and 2 diamonds!
   I took the string back to my house and made a bow, some arrows, and a fishing rod with it. There's plenty left over too.
***</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 24</a><div class="page-content">   I've had some success fishing so far, although I keep catching Pufferfish. I have no use for Pufferfish really and I doubt anyone is willing to trade for them.
   I'd like to open up a tavern/pub in New Danzilona. There's an old Cornerstone</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 24</a><div class="page-content">Office next to my house that would be perfect for it. If I can convince the town to repurpose it I may have a nice little business on my hands. But first I have to build my inventory, with wheat and fish. Hopefully I'll be able to get other crops soon.</div></div>

   My tavern idea has been submitted to the town for a vote. So far it seems highly likely that I will succeed. I'm looking forward to it.
   I'm helping tear down the crappy house next to mine. I saw on the subreddit</div></div>

   Went mining and got some more iron which is great, I'm in dire need of it at the moment. I think I may remodel my house soon, although if I did I think this time it would have to be perfect.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 24</a><div class="page-content">   Took a look over at Swisston. I had no idea it was so close to New Danzilona. Basically all I saw were some pumpkins and some funny signs. Not bad.

   Just had some PvP training with TrackBall. He says he wants to make a sort of town</div></div>

   Just talked with Azelair about his future plans as Infrastructure Representative. It was interesting. We don't always see eye to</div></div>
