True Democracy:
A commentary on the Tyrannical, Oligarchic, Plutocratic, Representative, and overall un-free and anti-democratic governments that dominate the politics of Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Inclusion is vital to the human spirit. There are few pains in life more acute than the feeling of being excluded. Our very instincts drive us to seek inclusion through the gimmick of being "normal". From inclusion comes the pleasant social 
experience</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 34</a><div class="page-content">of life. Collaboration, conversation, recognition, even affection and competition have as their prerequisite the genuine inclusion into some group. 

A government that is perceived as fair is invariably one that 
includes all of the</div></div>

In the declarations of governments, namely laws, there is a distinction that must be made between <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>and <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de facto</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>. When a law or rule is made, it
is sometimes the</div></div>

People are often given rights that are never exercised or cannot be exercised because of other arrangements. Titles conveyed on people are often meaningless. To discuss this distinction between image and 
reality, the term<span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 34</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure </span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>is used to describe the law or rule as it is written and §s<span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de facto</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> is <span class="fmtcode">§r</span>used <span class="fmtd"><span class="fmtcode">§d</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

What happens in practice is, of course, important. It is not the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> government</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 34</a><div class="page-content">that conveys the
sense of fairness onto people, but the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de facto</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> community in which people feel included and valued. That is why a "Monarchy" may be more loved than a "Democracy". It is also why a government may receive broad</div></div>

that laws or regulations are actually enforced, at which time discontents will emerge to complain that others are "pulling rank".

Power is not a sword – it is a relationship</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 34</a><div class="page-content">between people. The word is used for many things but in relation 
to government it is the ability of one person or group to compel or prevent action by another person or group. Certainly, access to weapons and other physical tools of war is source</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 34</a><div class="page-content">of power, but one man (or woman) cannot accomplish much even 
with the best weapons. Rather, the greater source of power is the ability of one to call upon many to join in a common cause.

Like a horse attached to a lead, law and reality always move</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 34</a><div class="page-content">toward each other. But which is the horse and which is the man?
Behind the <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de facto</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> equality that members of a small community may enjoy can be a <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>de jure</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> inequality. A lowly citizen without any special rank or title may suddenly find himself</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 34</a><div class="page-content">excluded when procedures which were once overlooked begin to be followed. Likewise, a leader who has often shared power with those around him may face insurrection when he tries to exercise power. 

Why then, do so many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 34</a><div class="page-content">members of our community content themselves with a lowly status, subordinate 
to kings and "-archs", to ministers, to all manner of autocrats and dictators? The sole reason is the desire to be normal. In the process of 
learning, individuals</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 34</a><div class="page-content">gain a limited view of the world. They see, or imagine, others living without title, 
lorded over by those who claim titles, and accept this state of affairs as normal and natural. They do not consider whether it is, in fact, extremely 
stupid.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 34</a><div class="page-content">While it is natural to think of Democracy as antithetical to tyranny, it also stands
opposed to unnecessary representative systems. In a community that numbers less than 100 people – even a 
community that numbers less than</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 34</a><div class="page-content">1000 people – there is no need for representatives for any issue of internal 
affairs. A representative would only be necessary for external representation to other communities. This is the origin of the 
very concept of a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 34</a><div class="page-content">House of Representatives such as exists in the United States. There are many silly arguments 
for the benefits of a representative system, and I cannot presciently debunk all of them, but I would like to address a few.

First, representative</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 34</a><div class="page-content">systems do not speed up the functioning of the Government. If the measurement is taken correctly -- from 
the beginning of planning to the final execution of plans -- there are many 
drawbacks and advantages to both a democratic and a
representative</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 34</a><div class="page-content">approach to project management. Coming together as equals and sharing ideas naturally creates 
more possibilities for good designs than leaving such work to one person. It also 
encourages delegation of tasks and motivates everyone to work 
together.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 34</a><div class="page-content">On the other hand, it could encourage shirking. Furthermore, a project in which many people partici-
pate carries less risk than one led by a single individual, simply because if that single individual is absent for an extended period, the project will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 34</a><div class="page-content">languish. Of course, a democratic system could still appoint a project manager for a specific project 
to achieve the same result as a representative system but without conferring a title and nebulously transferring power 
away from the citizens.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Secondly, representative systems are not "safer" than democratic ones. 
Here "safe" means a political process that is difficult to usurp or abuse. Certainly, any system must have a constitution that 
conveys appropriate rights to people.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 34</a><div class="page-content">Among these is a standard of citizenship that protects the community from a sudden influx 
of immigrants who may have different values or a differing vision 
from the existing community. It is simply not the case that 
Democracies fail in this</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 34</a><div class="page-content">respect. One might ask "safer for whom?" Obviously a minister or "-arch" will feel very "safe" because 
only they are able to abuse power in a non-democratic 
system. But the average citizen will always fear that those above them will abuse</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 34</a><div class="page-content">their power. The dictator who holds all power and therefore feels fully secure, leaves the peasantry below him with no
choice but to pray that he will agree with and support their ideas. 

Third, representative 
systems do not better</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 34</a><div class="page-content">serve the people. So often the representative is not available and so the citizens must wait for his decision. 
Disempowered, they are unable to organize on their own.  The representative, of course, feels the convenience of not 
being required to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 34</a><div class="page-content">consult with anyone before making a decision. Once again, the representative system only serves the representative 
better. 

In conclusion, there is no reason to accept any authority from lords, ministers, etc. 
Peoples should</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 34</a><div class="page-content">voluntarily organize to discuss issues as equals, and refuse all false and divisive titles. This is the only sensible means by 
which a community ought be organized.


Therefore I call upon the lords and leaders, ministers and -archs</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 34</a><div class="page-content">of this land to put aside their false titles and pursue a new constitution that properly and fairly recognizes human equality.
