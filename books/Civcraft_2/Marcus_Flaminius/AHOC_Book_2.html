Lisgrad waited for</div></div>

fighting against many 
weak city-states who 
did not really have the manpower. Only

Lisgrad was empty, 
completely devoid of 
all students and 
professors. It was 
unfit to hold meetings in the Ministerial Parliament. The city was beyond complete repair. There were too few citizens left to fix the damage,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of my comrades, decided to start something new. I 
recreated my old 
group "Halcyon", 
essentially a Minecraft clan. I invited my friends with me to recreate what we had done on ROM's old server - the Nexus. We ventured out to the edges of the world</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and begun building what could have been Halcyon's most ambitious project, The Nexus IV. Three Nexi had been built 
previously, each 
increasing in size. It 
was essentially a 
monolithic tower that 
was utterly impossible 
to enter. Never 
before had the</div></div>

raided. However, the project never got underway. After we had dug out a roughly 50x50 hole down to bedrock, we got bored. I went on vacation and the remaining members lost interest in the project. When I 
returned, Halcyon's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">short run had come to an end. After this point, I quit the server. I did not 
have the time to sacrifice to my 
Minecraft endeavours 
anymore. So, I cannot 
speak of the history in the next month or two. 
However, upon my 
return, I was able to 
find out</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">a few things. The rest of the world never really recovered from the Red Moon. The Black Knights had dealt the final blow to civilization on CivRealms. The 0,0 
continent remained 
uninhabited and 
Dill_weasel was soon 
banned for hacking. 
Only minor</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">settlements remained, scattered throughout the world. The Bashnya Lisgrada, the tallest tower on the server (besides the admin-build Monolith at 
0,0), stood over a 
barren ghost town. 
However, upon my 
revisit in December 
2013, some attempts 
were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">made by some 
strangers to rebuild 
the city. I do not remember their names. I don't know who they were. Whoever it was, I thank you for attempting to rebuild the glorious city of Lisgrad. Nonetheless, the rest of the server remained fairly dead.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It remained this way 
until the server reset and a new map was created. CivRealms v2
was underway. A new 
chapter in the lifetime 
of CivRealms takes 
way.

<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">what happened in the 
very beginnings of the
new server. I was absent from the
server in its first 2 
weeks of existence. 
However, when I first 
arrived 2 weeks later 
I quickly got back into 
the hang of things. 
Several major 
settlements had 
already</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">sprouted up: 
Vroengard and 
Lichfield. I journeyed 
to visit the two cities. 
When I first visited Vroengard, I found a rectangular wall being built around some sort of courtyard. Upon being seen by one of its residents I was told to go away or I would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">be killed. Thus, I obeyed and left. I then visited Lichfield, then a fairly modest settlement. The people of Blackstone Keep remained hidden in the darkness. I doubt myself or anyone else has seen what the glorious Blackstone Keep could have ever looked</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">like. Thus, I contemplated my options. In Lisgrad, I was often disconnected from server events. 
However I was 
prepared for more 
action. I planned to 
take more initiative in 
the roles of the 
server. I no longer 
wished to be a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">spectator. So, I 
founded the Roman 
Orthodox Muslim 
Church. We declared the area around 0,0, to be Holy Land and demanded it not be tarnished. We wanted to preserve 0,0 as a sanctious and undisturbed place, 
contrary to what it 
ended up being on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">previous map. Thus, I 
commenced building a 
massive wall to encircle the area 
around spawn; It had 
roughly a diameter of 
800 blocks. These 
walls remain standing 
today. I built a small 
mosque on a mountain 
near the edge of the 
Holy Land. For the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">most part, the Holy 
Land remained 
undisturbed. I 
recruited a few other 
saintly people into my 
Church. No other 
major builds were 
attempted during this 
period. I dug out a 
large hole in the 
ground at 0,0 to 
create a Nexus for 
the railways that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">were to be built by nations. I intended on serving as a neutral party to bring diplomacy to all of the world's people in a Holy, neutral land. Thus, the ROM church 
began to send out 
missionaries to foreign cities. The missionary 
to Lichfield was met</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">with gifts and 
hospitality. While 
nobody was really 
converted to the
True Faith, it established positive 
relations between the 
Roman Orthodox Muslim Church and the city of Lichfield. A missionary 
was also sent to 
Vroengard. By this 
time,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Vroengard had 
become the leading 
power on the server. 
A very large proportion of the server's active players were in 
Vroengard or one of 
its colonies. They were essentially the sole 
superpower on the 
server. The missionary sent was turned away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Days later, a military 
convoy came to me 
while I was digging in 
the hole at 0,0. Consisting of several Vroengard members, I was attacked and jailed by a member of Vroengard's "tetrarchy". I was told they pearled me 
because they believed my missionary</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to have been a spy or soldier who was creating a "forward base" to attack Vroengard. It was also demanded I convert from my religion to the Admin Cult, the religion 
followed by the 
majority of 
Vroengard's 
residents. I rejected 
the demand and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">instead opted to 
escape from the jail. 
This was my first
altercation with the 
increasingly fascist threat of Vroengard. 
Upon my return to the 
Holy Land I had to 
play extra safe. 
Vroengard's actions 
had gained it some 
dissent across the 
server.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Redstone blocks (bulwarks) began to be placed by 
Vroengard in the Holy 
land underground. They continued their 
imperialistic expansion 
into the helpless 
residents of the 
Roman Orthodox Muslim Church. My requests 
for them to stop were 
joked upon.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Nothing could stop them now. There was nobody of any threat to oppose them on the server. Or was there? Perhaps when the spotlight is shined upon these events, one ignores what happens in the 
background. Like an 
agent skillfully 
manuevering a field of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">mines, the denizens of 
CivRealm's furthest
reaches look down at 
the server from the 
top of their Ivory Tower. However it is not their necessity to take part in this. Fed up with Vroegard's imperialism, I left the Holy Land. The walls encircled a newly</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">empty, snowy,

driven out by a force 
that nobody could stand up against.

<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">tension and little real action. An exception was the looting of Lichfield by 
Vroengard. The 
aggressors had believed the city to be abandoned so they did theirselves the favors of consolidating the city's demise. The city's old owner posted on the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">reddit pictures of the ruins and expressed discontent with Vroengard's actions.
