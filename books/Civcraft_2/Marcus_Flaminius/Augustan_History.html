If you look to the right of the portal when exiting, you'll see a Memorial to N5K2. N5K2 was the first city built on the land that is now Augusta.</div></div>

Shortly after it was abandoned, a man named Vidorac moved in to the area, put down hundreds of torches, and built a city he named Torchville. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">"Vidorac lived here for a while, but after numerous intense griefing episodes, he and his friends fled the city. "</div></div>

The city grew and grew into the walls the founding fathers had built."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">However, Augusta soon fell into a very dark time. We got into a war of sorts with some griefers, one of which stayed on us for a long time. (The griefer mentioned here is
FoxMcleod, now reformed and a citizen of Gerald. [cont]</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">"The spawn trap built for him is now a historical monument in Augusta.)

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">would later be repeated by many griefers. At the time of writing, Ataraxia is still under cobble.)
