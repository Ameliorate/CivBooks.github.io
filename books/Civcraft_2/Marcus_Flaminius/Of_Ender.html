</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> Endermen are a peculiar race of Hominid (<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Homo Finis</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>, "End Man"), which are around 2 Steves high, 1 Steve wide, and are Ink Black in colour.
 Endermen are found within the Overrealm. Their eyes are Nether Portal Violet.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 24</a><div class="page-content"> Caution is advised when viewing their eyes, for they can only safely be seen while wearing a Pumpkin.
 Endermen are usually neutral and will only attack when aggravated, or when looked at in the eyes.
When killed, Endermen can teleport</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 24</a><div class="page-content">short distances instantaneously, and exhume Portal particles.


<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>      History</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

 Endermen have been with the Overrealm since Evolution Era Designation "BETA 1.8", but true origins are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 24</a><div class="page-content">very sketchy.
 Some proof points to the disintegrated Far Lands, while others point to a mysterious floating dimension outside human reach. Other folk tales speak of green eyes, and the ability to displace Bedrock.
 Current subjects are not seen to have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 24</a><div class="page-content">either abilities.


<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>     Behaviours</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

 Endermen are very docile, and susceptible to move small blocks such as grassed and empty surface, clay, sand and gravel.
 They have also been seen to carry</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 24</a><div class="page-content">dandelions, roses and both kinds of small mushrooms, cacti, pumpkins, and melons.
 In very rare cases, Endermen have been seen to carry TNT. It happens mainly within armories.
 Speaking with Mobologists, focusing on Endermen, they have agreed that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 24</a><div class="page-content">they have shown some, if small, levels of creativity, and wish to become part of the system of Mankind.
 Water is the Enderman's weakness, and stray away from it as much as possible. When it rains, Endermen have been seen to teleport everywhere until they</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 24</a><div class="page-content">either reach a rain-proof area, or die.


<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>  Pearls and Exp</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

 When slain, Endermen have been seen to dissolve Exp, as typical of all mobs. They also drop a bluish-green pearl, dubbed by</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 24</a><div class="page-content">many as "Ender Pearls".
 Ender Pearls have the ability of teleporting humans when thrown. The experience is not for the faint-hearted, however, due to side-effects with physical health, and quick and sharp pain within the legs.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 24</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>   Eyes of Ender</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

 If combined with crushed Blaze Rod, Ender Pearls become an entirely new substance, dubbed "Eyes of Ender".
 The eyes are as hard as Bedrock, possibly harder, but are only destroyed if deployed into the air.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 24</a><div class="page-content">" Wherever it is being thrown, it always leads to a nearby area, with possible a Stronghold. Ancient texts believe that it leads to a more ancient realm, steeped in darkness."</div></div>

 The Academy of Natural Philosophy was given enough funding to support this venture. They were reluctant to give away all those Eyes.
