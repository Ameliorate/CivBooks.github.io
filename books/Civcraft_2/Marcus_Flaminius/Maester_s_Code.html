It is with great joy that I record the laws of our Order upon these pages. Over the last few weeks, the peace following the HCF War has caused our craft to flourish. Many others across the world have begun to donate works to our</div></div>

Anyone who wishes to join the Order of the Maesters are welcome to our ranks. They may join from any city, follow any ideology, be of any age or sex, and own as much as they wish. The only law imposed upon them is the prohibition of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 27</a><div class="page-content">violence against any other member of the Maesters. However, they are encouraged to give up all claims, renounce their current loyalties, and live at the Citadel. Indeed, those living in the Citadel shall have no more than a few personal possessions:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 27</a><div class="page-content">a weapon, a set of armor, and a private journal.

To maintain consistency, all works created by the Maesters must meet certain standards:

1) All works must begin with a title page, with the title of the work centered as well as possible and the name of the original author</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 27</a><div class="page-content">directly underneath.

2) Serious entries must employ a reasonably high level of grammar. Lesser grammar may only be accepted in parodic or comedic works.

3) Original works must include a postscript on its own page reading:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 27</a><div class="page-content">"Written by [name] on [date] for the benefit of the Citadel and the rest of Civcraft."

4) Transcribed works (from BookWorm entries or external works) must include a postscript reading: "This is the original work of [author's name]. It has been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 27</a><div class="page-content">transcribed [from BookWorm (if applicable)] to Book and Quill by [name] for the benefit of the Citadel and the rest of Civcraft."

5) All books must be proofread by at least one Council Maester before publication. Once published, a copy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 27</a><div class="page-content">
will immediately be made and placed within the book vault in the Citadel. From there, a copy of the work is free to be donated to any person or state within Civcraft.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Written by Ttocs_is_Awe on 2/25/13 for the benefit of the Citadel and the rest of Civcraft.</div></div>
