  I was told about the case in Texas, but it had happened in another state. It has a single protagonist (though in every story there are thousands of protagonists, visible and invisible, alive and dead). The man's name, I believe, was Fred</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 19</a><div class="page-content">Murdock. He was tall, as Americans are; his hair was neither blond nor dark, his features were sharp, and he spoke very little. There was nothing singular about him, not even that feigned singularity that young men affect. He was naturally respectful,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 19</a><div class="page-content">and he distrusted neither books nor the men and women who write them. He was at that age when a man doesn't yet know who he is, and so is ready to throw himself into whatever chance puts in his way-Persian mysticism or the unknown origins of Hungarian</div></div>

At the university, an adviser had interested him in Amerindian languages. Certain esoteric rites still survived in certain tribes out West; one of his professors, an older man, suggested that he go live</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content">on a reservation, observe the rites, and discover the secret revealed by the medicine men to the initiates. When he came back, he would have his dissertation, and the university authorities would see that it was published.
  Murdock leaped at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">the suggestion. One of his ancestors had died in the frontier wars; that bygone conflict of his race was now a link. He must have foreseen the difficulties that lay ahead for him; he would have to convince the red men to accept him as one of their own. He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 19</a><div class="page-content">set upon the long adventure. He lived for more than two years on the prairie, sometimes sheltered by adobe walls and sometimes in the open. He rose before dawn, went to bed at sundown, and came to dream in a language that was not that of his fathers. He</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">conditioned his plate to harsh flavors, he covered himself with strange clothing, he forgot his friends and the city, he came to think in a fashion that the logic of his mind rejected. During the first few months of his new education he secretly took</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">notes; later, he tore the notes up-perhaps to avoid drawing suspicion upon himself, perhaps because he no longer needed them. After a period of time (determined upon in advance by certain practices, both spiritual and physical), the priest instructed</div></div>

The young man found that on nights of the full moon he dreamed of buffalo. He reported these recurrent dreams to his teacher; the teacher at last</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">revealed to him the tribe's secret doctrine. One morning, without saying a word to anyone, Murdock left.
  In the city, he was homesick for those first evenings on the prairie when, long ago, he had been homesick for the city. He made his way to his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">professor's office and told him that he knew the secret, but had resolved not to reveal it.
  "Are you bound by your oath?" the professor asked.
  "That's not the reason," Murdock replied. "I learned something out there</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">that I can't express."
  "The English language may not be able to communicate it," the professor suggested.
  "That's not it, sir. Now that I possess the secret, I could tell it in a hundred different and even contradictory ways. I don't know how to tell</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">you this, but the secret is beautiful, and science, <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>our</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> science, seems mere frivolity to me now."
  After a pause, he added:
  "And anyway, the secret is not as important as the paths that led me to it. Each person has to walk those paths himself."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">  The professor spoke coldly:
  "I will inform the committee of your decision. Are you planning to live among the Indians?"
  "No," Murdock answered. "I may not even go back to the prairie. What the men of the prairie taught</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 19</a><div class="page-content">me is good anywhere and for any circumstances."
  That was the end of their conversation.
  Fred married, divorced, and is now one of the librarians at Yale.</div></div>
