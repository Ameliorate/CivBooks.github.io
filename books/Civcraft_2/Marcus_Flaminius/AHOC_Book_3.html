And so here we are 
today. My aim in 
creating this book was to present a history 
of the server. I 
wanted to show what 
worked and what didn't on CivRealms. It's a 
unique server indeed. 
What</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 22</a><div class="page-content">works on a factions server 
does not necessarily 
work here. The same is true of a towny server. It calls for an interesting playstyle, 
one that requires you 
to think critically and 
weigh the diplomatic 
repercussions of 
your actions. Unless, 
of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 22</a><div class="page-content">course, nobody can really stop you. Then 
you can do whatever 
the hell you want. But 
such is the nature of 
civilization. The 
powerful will subdue 
the weak. Do not trust 
power. Over the 
course of CivRealms 
there has not been 
one benevolent</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 22</a><div class="page-content">superpower. They are 
all interested in furthering their own 
agenda, and for good 
reason to. Who would 
not want to improve 
one's own condition? I 
speak as someone who has been on this 
server since the day 
it started. I have done many attempts at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 22</a><div class="page-content">creating nations. 
Lisgrad worked well, 
but nobody could stop the onslaught of the Black Knights. The Roman Orthodox Church worked well, but it never had the 
manpower to stand up 
to foreign threats. 
Essia worked well, but 
it didn't have the activity</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 22</a><div class="page-content">to keep it going. I guess they all had their own failures, but on CivRealms, one failure will result in death. You die once and you could be pearled for eternity. Mistakes are heavily punished here. You have to always be 
on your feet, and not 
many</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 22</a><div class="page-content">people can handle that. So, always 
remember, the organized nations with 
a clearly defined 
purpose and agenda 
are ones that will 
succeed. Make some 
5-year plans or 
something. And good 
luck. Perhaps one day 
I can see the glory 
days of CivRealms</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 22</a><div class="page-content">again. It has been long since we saw the 
dynamic political scene of CivRealms, one of many different 
competing city-states, 
all vying for power. 
That type of 
competition can't be 
seen on the CivRealms 
of today. Nonetheless, 
you can still build</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 22</a><div class="page-content">and reinforce some cute palace or something. Just don't tell anybody where it is.
