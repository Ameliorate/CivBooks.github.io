  The moon still shone above me when I left the safety of the building/farm. I could no longer wait with nothing to do. I wondered if someone would one day return to where I just left.
  Not far from the building I discovered trees planted in a</div></div>

  With a new-found map of the world, I began heading North-East where it hinted at civilization. The first</div></div>

  After walking along it for a short time, I found a whole in it</div></div>
