<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 40</a><div class="page-content">It was a blistering hot summer day in River's End. A flock of slaves worked tirelessly at the city's orchard, cutting lumber, the occasional slave deviating from the task whipped, and sent back to the End.

Despite wearing minimal clothing, sweat</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 40</a><div class="page-content">constantly dripped from the faces, and bodies of slaves, stinging their eyes, making their dirty, beaten skin shine.

Even the slave masters, whose only task was to watch and whip, have removed their shirts, letting their bodies soak up</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 40</a><div class="page-content">sunlight and burn.

AiXyZ and Phacad, the two most notorious of these slavers sat on blankets spread out over the dry, crispy grass, casually drinking regen potions. 
Both men looked calmly at the slaves, working away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Neither expressed significant concern over any number of threats facing the loathed city. Neither paid attention to the faint cries, and clashing of metal as a volunteer force tried to purge the city, or as one slave after another deviated, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 40</a><div class="page-content">was whipped.

Phacad took one last sip from his potion, before throwing the empty bottle to the ground.

Sighing with tranquility in the air, under the sun, with his friend, as he satiated his sadistic desires,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 40</a><div class="page-content">he lay down, onto his back, putting his hands behind his head. He placed a large, lush leaf over his eyes, to block out the sun.

As he heard the sound of a whip cracking, and an anguished cry, he felt a faint tingling in his shorts. AiXyZ, whom was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 40</a><div class="page-content">still next to him, let out a quiet moan of pleasure.

"This is a beautiful day, today," Phacad heard AiXyZ say, "the weather, the slaves, the city. All so perfect"

"Mhm," replied phacad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"What do you find to be the most beautiful thing you see today?"
Phacad asked.

Phacad heard AiXyZ roll, and then felt a large, hard hand rest on his stomach.

"Your body," AiXyZ whispered. His voice,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 40</a><div class="page-content">so perfect, so
erotic, sent a shiver down Phacad's back. He remained unmoving, a smile of euphoria slowly crossed his lips.

Another crack of a whip, another scream of agony. Both of the Rechargers moaned quietly with pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Phacad felt AiXyZ's body next to his own, his sticky, hot torso, softly pressed against his side.

"How much do you want me?" AiXyZ whispered into Phacad's ear.

"Almost as much as I want Ryden pearled"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"Good enough for me!" AiXyZ squealed with pleasure, and dropped himself fully on top of Phacad. 

A large, thunderous thump was heard as one tree fell against another, and cheers amongst the slaves 
was heard.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 40</a><div class="page-content">The tree was dragged along, as it firmly pushed against the ground beneath it.

"Oh AiXyZ," Phacad said, embracing his sadistic friend.

The two, together, made sweet love in the open air, to the sounds of battle, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 40</a><div class="page-content">the sounds of slaves labouring all around them.

Over the next few days, life at River's End carried on normally. Apart from the occasional individual stupid enough to venture 

alone outside River's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 40</a><div class="page-content">End, fighting barely
happened. Slaves were occasionally summoned to carry out labour tasks when River's End citizenry didn't feel like doing the task themselves.

It was overcast over these days, the sun poking through from</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 40</a><div class="page-content">time to time. The heat subsided, and clothes
were fully worn.

Most people remained inside their houses. Without anything to do, most were lethargic, though a few carried on menial tasks that needed doing, such as repairing factories, and reviving</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 40</a><div class="page-content">snitches.

It was mid afternoon,
and Phacad was inside the main armoury, in the centre of the city, when bloodidiot strolled in, holding a chest of diamonds.

"Oh, hello," he said awkwardly, "Sorry to bother your."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"Not at all," Phacad said, forcing a smile.
He pretended to rummage in one chest, obviously masking the real reason he was in here.

"Looking for something?" bloodidiot asked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"I, uh, yes, just..." he stammered.

Bloodidiot craned his neck to see what was inside that chest.

"If you're looking for diamonds, I've a fresh batch here, just arrived from Nexus."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"No, thank you," Phacad said politely.

"Seriously, why are
you in here?" Bloodidiot asked, dropping the diamonds, and putting his arm around Phacad.

"I came in here to think," Phacad said quietly.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"If it's about you and AiXyZ, it's okay," bloodidiot said, 
sympthetically, "if you feel that way about another man, we can talk about it."

"No, no. I don't need to talk about that. But." Phacad hesitated.

"Yes,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"AiXyZ asked me out, and I didn't know what
to say. I told him I'd get back to him."

"Well," bloodidiot said, "you should just follow your heart. If your heart tells you to say yes, then say yes. There's no wrong answer".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"Thank you, blood," Phacad replied, smiling
faintly.

"Not a problem, Phacad! If you ever need to talk, I'm here," Bloodidiot said, pecking Phacad on the cheek. He left the room, leaving Phacad alone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 40</a><div class="page-content">Phacad left the building a few minutes after, and paced around the city. A couple of times, he was passed by other members of the city, all notorious criminals. Some seemed to notice his nervousness, other simply walked by. 
After feeling a few</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 40</a><div class="page-content">rain on his head, he decided to head indoors. He headed to his own house, where he began browsing his wardrobe for something to wear for his date on Friday.

No sooner did he open his wardrobe door, then he heard a knock at his door.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 40</a><div class="page-content">He ran downstairs, and opened the door, to see AiXyZ standing there, nervously, looking at him.

"AiXyZ!" Phacad exclaimed, "Come on in!"

"Actually, AiXyZ said, looking at the floor, "I was wondering, since</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 40</a><div class="page-content">wanted to go for a walk outside?"

"Oh my gosh," Phacad thought to himself, "AiXyZ remembers that I enjoy the rain."

"Certainly! Let me just get changed," Phacad 
blurted out, but as he turned around, AiXyZ grabbed him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"You're fine just the way you are," he said, before playing with Phacad's ear momentarily. Phacad blushed.

"Okay, let's go," he said.


The two held hands, and walked outside,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 40</a><div class="page-content">down the rain.
Before Phacad asked where they were going, AiXyZ pulled Phacad off the city street, and towards a small hole in the wall. He pulled Phacad through, and began running through the rolling hills.

Before too long, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 40</a><div class="page-content">two were out of sight 
immense wall, and both soaking wet from the rain.

"Where are we going?" Phacad asked.

"You'll see when we get there."

The two continued 
walking, footsteps in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 40</a><div class="page-content">sync, fingers 
intertwined. The rain kept coming down harder, and lightning flashed in the distance. Both men removed their shirts, and wrung them out.

"We're almost there," AiXyZ said.

They kept walking.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 40</a><div class="page-content">"Tell me where you're taking me!" Phacad pleaded.

"You'll see when we get there, baby," AiXyZ said, grinning, "just over this hill now.

The men reached the 
top of the hill, short of breath, and looked over a massive ocean.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 40</a><div class="page-content">To the horizon in every direction stretched endless reaches of water.

"It's absolutely beautiful," Phacad said.

The cloud front ended soon beyond the shore line, exposing a brilliant orange mass</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 40</a><div class="page-content">the horizon in the distance.

"Why did you bring me here?" Phacad asked.

"Look down," AiXyZ said. "At the river".

Phacad looked down 
the side of the cliff. Sure enough a river flowed, the same river</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 40</a><div class="page-content">which flowed alongside River's End, the river for which the city was named after.

"What about it?" Phacad asked.

"Look what direction the water is flowing."

Phacad strained his eyes, trying to see</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 40</a><div class="page-content">down the cliffside into the narrow canyon. All of a sudden, his entire life's dream came crashing down, and he let out an agonised cry of shame, as he saw the water flowing into the ocean.

"This," AiXyZ said 
sadly, "is the real river's end."</div></div>
