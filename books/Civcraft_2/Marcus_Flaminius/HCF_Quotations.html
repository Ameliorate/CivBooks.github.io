You think you know what griefing and murder is..
The blood of the innocent and unjust shall flow like the ancient rivers of Babylon.</div></div>

There is no point in trying to reason with us anymore, you've unleashed cruel unfathomable hatred upon your server.</div></div>

I haven't been on the server for a while, so can someone explain to me what this hcf ordeal is about?

Hcf came in and started raiding people. Some of them got pearled and locked in Foofed's vault. Group</div></div>

It's funny.
I never thought I would see the day when all of hcfactions would put aside their differences and work together to bring down a server for the unjust banning and treatment of people.</div></div>

It's amazing.
