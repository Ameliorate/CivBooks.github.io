I would, therefore, in the first place, beg of him to lay aside all prejudice, and</div></div>

  I need not here point out the considerable importance to humanity of an international language - a language unconditionally accepted by everyone, and the common property of the whole</div></div>

How much time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues, and yet when travelling in foreign countries, we are, as a rule, unable to converse with other human beings in their own language. How much time, labour, and money are wasted in</div></div>

  Were there but an international language, all translations would</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 39</a><div class="page-content">be made into it alone, as into a tongue intelligible to all, and works of an international character would be written in it in the first instance.
  The Chinese wall dividing literatures would disappear, and the works of other</div></div>

  How different would the case be, had we</div></div>

It is, therefore, imperative that the slightest effort in that direction should be attended to. The best years of my life have been devoted to the momentous cause which I am now bringing before the public, and I hope that, on account of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 39</a><div class="page-content">importance of the subject, my readers will peruse this pamphlet attentively to the end.
  I shall not here enter upon an analysis of the various attempts already made to give the public a universal language, but will content myself with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 39</a><div class="page-content">remarking that these efforts have amounted, either to a short system of mutually-intelligible signs, or to a natural simplification of the grammar of existing modern languages, with a change of their words into arbitrarily-formed ones. The attempts of</div></div>

The inventors called</div></div>

If a language, in order to become universal, has but to be named</div></div>

As these authors naively imagined that their essays would be enthusiastically welcomed and taken up by the whole world, and as this unanimous</div></div>

The greater part of the world was not in</div></div>

When the</div></div>

And so a scheme, which had it but been able to number some thousands of adepts before its appearance in public, would have been enthusiastically</div></div>

If the "Volapük", one of the latest attempts at a universal tongue, has indeed its adepts, it owes its popularity solely to the idea of its being a "universal language", and that idea has in itself</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 39</a><div class="page-content">minute study of the problem. At length, however, some happy ideas, the fruits of my reflections, incited me to further work, and induced me to essay the systematic conquest of the many obstacles, which beset the path of the inventor of a new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 39</a><div class="page-content">rational universal language. As it appears to me that I have almost in my undertaking, I am now venturing to lay before the critical public, the results of my long and assiduous labours.
  The principal difficulties to be overcome were:</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 39</a><div class="page-content">  1) To render the study of the language so easy as to make its acquisition mere play to the learner.
  2) To enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality, whether the language be universally accepted or not; in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 39</a><div class="page-content">other words, the language is to be directly a means of international communication.
  3) To find some means of overcoming the natural indifference of mankind, and disposing them, in the quickest manner possible, and en masse, to learn and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 39</a><div class="page-content">use the proposed language as a living one, and not only in last extremities, and with the key at hand.
