CivRealms, in comparison to other servers, has a relatively shorter history. However, its history has been packed with dynamic politics and interesting</div></div>

Nonetheless, the server has maintained a</div></div>

Chapter 1: The Founding of Lisgrad
- - - - - - - - - - - -
Some time in the Spring of 2013 I received a message from _ROM_, one of my close friends. I had played on several of his previous</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">servers such as Monolith, N+, "Four Kingdoms", among others. A common trend among them all was that they promoted a more passive, creative gameplay, but in the context of a sociopolitical atmosphere. Nonetheless, his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">details invitation to CivRealms seemed to exemplify all of the traits he had attempted before and put them into one. On paper, the server looked almost exactly like CivCraft. I played briefly on CivCraft but the server was too large for me; I got lost</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">too easily. I thought CivRealms would be an opportunity to attempt the "CivCraft" atmosphere on a more reasonable scale. So, I joined him on TeamSpeak and I planned on joining the server the day it was released. So, I did. My first day logging into the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> server, I invited a few friends of mine to come play with me, notably Ty0619 and rugdoc95. Utilizing the random spawn upon death feature, I killed myself until I found a good flat area to build a city. I found a "mid-point" between 3 different biomes: a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">jungle, a desert, and a hills biome, and decided to build a city there. Yes, it was somewhat arbitrary, however the location proved to be useful and helped make that city very unique in the coming months. So, 8,000 blocks away from spawn, I decided to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">found the city of Lisgrad, on the later-named continent of Lisgrad, obviously named after the city itself. Lisgrad was the only major city on the continent for the course of that map's existence. In my series of books, I intend on referring to the city</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of Lisgrad as simply Lisgrad, and the continent as Lisgrad(c). Thus, the oldest city on CivRealms was born. Lisgrad originally did not really have any advanced governing system. It was mostly myself and a few friends and I was essentially a dictator.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">At the time we were not really interested in adopting any advanced political system. As the days and weeks went by, several new cities sprouted up on the mainland continent (the one at 0,0). The most famous of them, Luxemburg, named after the socialist</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Rosa Luxemberg, stood until the server itself fell. Other cities on the mainland included the 0,0 Settlement (it never really had an official name), Redemptia, Dakun and a small outpost known as the Lightpoint Refuge. In the very early days of CivRealms</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I was not really involved that much in the political scene at 0,0. Due to Lisgrad's far distance from 0,0, we were never really exposed to much of the politics. It was only months later until Lisgrad became entangled in the affairs that were affecting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the whole server. Now, back to the city of Lisgrad. We did not really adopt an advanced architectural scheme back in Lisgrad. First, simple walls were erected, which were later built upon. Revolution Square was built in the center of the town,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">essentially a huge pavilion with a pedestal in the center. Private homes were never built in Lisgrad because as I got more of my friends on the server (from SCoM, the Socialist Commune of Minecraft), I had plans to transition the city from a dictatorship</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to a socialist republic. Outside of the previously mentioned objects, nothing of any particular importance was built in early Lisgrad, other than expansive road infrastructure and communal storage.

I often like to call the time around 2 months or so after Lisgrad's foundation to be the server's golden age. By this time, Luxemburg and Redemptia were thriving on the 0,0 continent and Lisgrad was undergoing its most expansive</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">architectural projects. Tornare and Dill_Weasel had consolidated power at 0,0, which originally a beneficial aspect to the server, later became an oppressive entity. It was during this time several influential people joined the city of Lisgrad through</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">SCoM, such as Akellian, TerrorTailor, and Captain_Juan. It was also the time when the first constitution of Lisgrad was adopted. One of the server's players, gingechris, created a map of 0,0 and many of the other continents. Many other settlements</div></div>

soon gave way to the 
centralization of power at 0,0. This was 
also the time when 
Lisgrad adopted its 
first constitution and 
included the founding 
of the United 
Libertarian Socialist 
Republics (ULSR).</div></div>

easily proved to have 
been very inefficient, 
and would have 
greatly furthered Lisgrad's downfall in 
the coming weeks of 
war and unrest. 
Akellian also claims 
that there was no 
communal sharing of 
resources. That is</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">blatantly untrue, as all
resources in Lisgrad

can ask any other

is no argument there.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Additionally, Akellian, 
without issuing a 
democratic vote, left 
the city of Lisgrad to 
create an outpost 
called Gramsci's Lake, under the ULSR. However he gave no access to the 
resources there to 
any other ULSR 
members and utilized 
the resources</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">there for his own private purposes. He 
contributed nothing to 
the city of Lisgrad 
and the unrest he 
caused based on his personal desire 
contributed to the 
downfall of Lisgrad in 
the coming weeks. 
Additionally, two 
members of the ULSR, 
rugdoc95</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and Ty0619, betrayed the ULSR. They pearled myself, 
Akellian, and several 
other citizens as they 
raided the vaults and 
took a few anvils. They then left to create their own state, ironically named 
the "Republic of 
Amicitia".

The story of Lisgrad's fall is often lost 
because towards the 
server's end, 0,0 was engulfed in its 
own political conflicts.

haven on the other 
side of the world, did

loss was the Great

most of the roads 
were constructed of</div></div>

not require that such

built. Nonetheless, in 
one night the majority of the city's roads and many other important buildings, including the Ministerial</div></div>
