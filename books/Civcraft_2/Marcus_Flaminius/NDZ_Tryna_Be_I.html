Feb. 25th, 2014
***
   I woke up in an unfamiliar place. It was flat and dark and no one called back at my calls. At the time of writing this journal I have since left that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 36</a><div class="page-content">place, but there were
desolate buildings all 
around. Walls of cobblestone with holes big enough to fit through. Then, a voice called out.
   His name was Chef Asdoi. He told me he was a newcomer like me who had found civilization. Apparently he had been</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 36</a><div class="page-content"> attacked but a person
stepped in and killed 
the criminal. It sounded like a safe enough place so I set out to find it.
   After a few mistakes in directions I found the Commonwealth. It's more massive than I can even believe. There most be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 36</a><div class="page-content">hundreds of people living here. What
a community. I can't 

wait to see what the next few days have in store for me.
***
   Saka NoYou has given me a temporary house. He's the stranger that helped Chef Asdoi and he</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 36</a><div class="page-content">seems nice enough. He gave me plenty of materials to start 
working on gathering 
resources for the town and myself. I asked him how much a plot of land cost and he told me that land was free in the Commonwealth. You just had to show that you were worthy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 36</a><div class="page-content"> of owning it. I set out to gather sand for another town
inhabitant in exchange for the materials to make this journal.
***
   Just made a few rounds of the city to try and get my bearings. It's so easy to get lost around here. I only explored</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 36</a><div class="page-content">two burroughs and that seemed like too much of it. Ironside is
gray and drab, made 
of metal and stone. I liked the temporary housing installation they have over there though, it's like a little community with a common area, not unlike a dorm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 36</a><div class="page-content"> seems to be the high class burrough, with tall buildings and
beautiful scenery. I 

saw a monument for a Lazuli War in 2012; I'll have to ask what that was all about. 
    The exit out of Concord leads straight to water which will be great for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 36</a><div class="page-content">fishing. I also managed to find two squid which helped me finish the 

creation of this 

journal.

   Just got done doing some destruction work for Rykleos, a new person I just met. he seems to have some</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 36</a><div class="page-content">influence in the town.

February 26th, 2014
***
   Today I set out to
find New Danzilona. I 

started by mining to try and find iron to craft a minecart, but instead found clay and coal which I was able to trade with tomutwit.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 36</a><div class="page-content">   Following this trade Tom gave me directions to the train station and instructions on 


how to get to New 

Danzilona via the train line. I'm currently riding the subway as I write this out, and I sure hope I'm not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 36</a><div class="page-content">missing any important signs by doing so. I seem to be going an awful long distance now without stopping.
***
   I've arrived in 
Carson. I met a 

townsperson who has helped me find the next connecting train line. It seems I must</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 36</a><div class="page-content">take the yellow line east and connect from there. The people so far in this world have been friendly. I hope I never meet an unfriendly one.
***
   The complexities of 
this world confound me. I've never been in a more confusing place it seems. I left</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 36</a><div class="page-content">the Commonwealth precisely for that reason. Finding something in that town was a 10 minute goose chase through towering skyscrapers and convoluted
staircases. My hope is that New Danzilona will be much simpler.
***
   The click clack of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 36</a><div class="page-content">my cart wheels is soothing in a strange way. I don't feel nervous about entering a new unfamiliar place. I started in one yesterday and it 
all right for me. The 

one thing I can't get out of my head is reading earlier about</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 36</a><div class="page-content">drama and war that had been going on in New Danzilona. Something about Moraco causing problems with no foreseeable end in sight. I certainly hope it's not as bad as 
it sounds. For all the 
confusion of the Commonwealth it did have safety on its</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 36</a><div class="page-content">side. A big place like that is hard to get around in I imagine. Any griefer would have a hard time finding me cooped up in my little room amidst towering megabuildings. 
It made me feel like a 
needle in a haystack.
***
   It might be helpful</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 36</a><div class="page-content">to list my inventory at the current moment, sailing along these rails. I have with me a bed, given to me by SakaNoYou, wood, an ample amount of cobblestone, a modest amount of coal I 
mined just earlier 

today, an iron pickaxe I received as payment</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 36</a><div class="page-content">for helping with some demolition work in the city, and loads of bread from the Commonwealth's farms. I certainly have a lot to thank the Commonwealth for, they put me on my feet. But 
unfortunately for 


both of us I didn't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 36</a><div class="page-content">realize then what I realized recently; that the city is not the place for me. Perhaps I can show my thanks later on as a show of goodwill.
***
   I stopped in Carbon for a brief instance (boy, it's hard to keep those two towns apart in my head) and I ran</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 36</a><div class="page-content">into Chef Asdoi! I was baffled that he happened to be so far away from where we both had started. He told me he was fishing here and was going to open up a fishing shop. Strange that just yesterday we 
were in such similar</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 36</a><div class="page-content">circumstances and in 24 hours fate has driven us on completely separate paths. 
***
   By my calculations I am now over 6 kilometers away from the Commonwealth, and still have not even reached Mt. Augusta 
yet. This world is on a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 36</a><div class="page-content">gigantic scale I can't comprehend. Without this railway I would have given up on finding Danzilona a long time ago.
***
   I arrived in Mt. Augusta and no one answered my call. It seems my next stop is Holy Tree and then 
after that I should be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 36</a><div class="page-content">in New Danzilona. Here's hoping.
***
   A man named Bountytech just called out to see if anyone is on. Given his semi-threatening name I didn't respond, hoping to avoid any conflict. While my supplies may be
meager, they still took</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 36</a><div class="page-content">time in acquiring them and I'd hate to lose them.
***
   I have reached Holy Tree and the sign in the station indicates that the next stop is New Danzilona. I'm eager now to see if it's what I imagine. 
   I've decided I can 
only keep this diary</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 36</a><div class="page-content">
going until about page 100 at the very most. Each time I open it the page turning process to get to where I last left off is tedious and I imagine it will get more and more time consuming as I continue, especially for short simple little 
updates each</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 36</a><div class="page-content">

time. We'll see how long it takes until I'm fed up with it and retire this notebook for good.
***
   I came up to a station without a stop and decided to hop out and inspect to make sure I wasn't passing through new Danzilona.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 36</a><div class="page-content">It wasn't, instead it 


was a place called Stoneburrow, which i take is very deep under the Earth by the looks of it. 
   Anyways, I had a second minecart I found on the Green Line back in the Commonwealth so while</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 36</a><div class="page-content">being forced to abandon my first 
minecart I have a 

spare. And this fact that I now no longer have a life line should one break doesn't worry me too greatly as I am nearing my destination. 
***
   I've made it to New</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Danzolina and there's been so much going on that I haven't had a
chance to put it all 

down on paper. First, when I arrived no one was here. I did some exploring, got the lay of the land and it's almost exactly how I imagined it. Fields of wheat carry</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 36</a><div class="page-content"> farther than the eye can see and it even has a public library!
   Anyways, much later 

I finally got someone high up in the town to give me a plot of land, which I only just finished creating. My first real house! It's simple and bland, but it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 36</a><div class="page-content">has a nice field next to it protected by fences and a bed upstairs.
