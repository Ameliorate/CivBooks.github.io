I joined civcraft one year ago, in the middle of the so famous HCF wars, I quickly learned some things about the server, about the farming in here, the low population of mobs and the citadel plug in by checking</div></div>

I spawned in (IIRC) +,+ I had one objective and it was to go to Columbia (at that time, the city was already dead) and then go to Rapture and stablish</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 27</a><div class="page-content">my residence in that wonderful city.

I started my journey by setting a waypoint to Columbia and then to Rapture, while I was in my travels, I started to get hungry and my food ran out minutes ago, I was scared of losing all the progress I made</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 27</a><div class="page-content">Until I found a city, well, not a city per se, it was just a Fortress-like settlement, nobody was on so I just grabbed some wheat, tended the crops, and made some bread, it was good to fill 3 bars instead of 1 or 2.

Then, while I was</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 27</a><div class="page-content">added the nether coords of the portals and I started my travels through the Nether, and there it was, the Columbia station, it was grifed but It didn't mattered, I went through the portal I saw it...

Columbia, it was magnificent, with</div></div>

But my happines only lasted a few seconds because I saw the scar that the HCF wars left on that city, lava and obsidian decorated the streets while</div></div>

I took the overworld rail system to rapture, I didn't had a cart so I had to walk...</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 27</a><div class="page-content">started my journey to Haven.

I joined Haven in the middle of the HCF/KFC invasion.

Haven was filled of melons and the residents tried to break the vault where a peculiar citizen was hold, that citizen was</div></div>

We freed him and the people in Haven started to rebuild the</div></div>

           1.0

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> So, Civtest was the vanilla server that the people on civcraft used when the DDoS attack happened, this kind of things was weird because nobody attacked us like that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 27</a><div class="page-content">So, in this server is where I met              Marcus_Flaminius, founder of Rapture, we became good friends and had a base underwater.

Also, in this server is where I started to make jokes about the situation, starting with making fun of the new</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 27</a><div class="page-content">World Police.

They were a group of banned players that wanted to "Protect" the people by inspecting they anuses.

I got my first drama karma after I posted a "meme" about that, it was good....</div></div>

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Sadly, I wasn't active when the new world started, I had some IRL stuff and I didn't had time to go to minecraft and build an empire based on me.

This time, I didn't wanted to explore</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 27</a><div class="page-content">I wanted to go back to 1.0, but that was impossible, the closest thing I had was Haven, so, after I spawned in this new world, I traveled from +,+ to -,- only to be back in Haven.

I reached Haven after a day of travelling on foot, I was happy</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 27</a><div class="page-content">to see that giant chicken decorating the gates of Haven...

I was greeted by Yagils, it was like I never left the town, she gave me a plot in 2.0 Yagsville and I started to build my house and re-start my e-lego life</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 27</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>          IV

    and the L.S.I.F.

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>I started my own guild called "The Maltese Falcon", I wanted it to be some sort of Mason-like brotherhood with the objective of being a neutral group who helps against griefing,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 27</a><div class="page-content">train newfriends and also build amazing structures.

But my project was eclipsed by my fear of being in charge of such a big project.

Then, I met the guys from the LSIF, they moved to Haven and started a comune,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 27</a><div class="page-content">they also started the building of the H-Dome Spleef arena, I started to work for them as a builder, after some time they were so glad to have me with them that they invited me to join their organization, and I kindly accepted.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 27</a><div class="page-content">But then I asked myself: "I am not a Social Justice Warrior, I am just a common man who likes to make jokes and play Political Minecraft, why do they want to add me to their lines?, I don't even believe in Communism!"

But after spending some time with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 27</a><div class="page-content">them I knew that they were just a bunch of people who didn't cared about my political compass or my sexuality, they just wanted to build things on minecraft and spread communism, so I stayed.</div></div>

So, this was my life inside Civcraft, I omitted some things about my life in 1.0 but it was irrelevant (like my travels to nine).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 27</a><div class="page-content">I wanted to thanks the following people:

- The people from Haven for giving me a home at the start of my life in this server.

- Marcus_Flaminus for being the best architect on this server (IMO)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 27</a><div class="page-content">- The LSIF, for being the laziest Social Justice Warriors I have ever seen

- hk219999 and Vithon for being the best motherfuckers/bros I had ever met on this server</div></div>
