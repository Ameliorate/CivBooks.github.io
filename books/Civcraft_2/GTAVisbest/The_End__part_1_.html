<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">on as he rummaged through chests, picking out pieces of dented iron and diamond armour.

The injustices comitted...</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>"
The man was slipping</div></div>

He then pulled out a shiny, glinting sword, and holstered it onto his back. Standing up, he shut the radio off and walked to the opposite side of the room. The door opened, creaked, was shut, and stillness overwhelmed once more."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">As he stepped outside a ray of piercing sunlight from behind the clouds caught him in the face, and he squinted. Answering the calls of "Hey, Nzucco", he started making his way down the roads towards downtown, carefully avoiding the griefed-out craters in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the street. Turning the corner and passing a couple of shuttered, broken buisnesses, he saw the still-majestic skyline of Mount Augusta ahead.
He entered downtown and passed the Gay Bar, which he noted was still closed. "Never have I seen that place</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">open since it was firebombed during the revolution..." he his attention back to the road.
A crowd of poorly dressed peasants and merchants were standing on Washington street. There was a commotion of sorts. Nzucco approached quietly from behind to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">peer to the street, where a procession of diamond clad soldiers in Prot with glinting diamond swords were marching past the dusty marketplace. "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Victory is upon us</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>", they were chanting. "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>RkWildCard is free, Myra will burn</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>". The procession made it's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Way towards the portal as the voices grew more distant. "Damn vault breakers", muttered a merchant next to him, dressed in a leather tunic. "Just the HCF in disguise". Farthur up the street, the chanting grew louder and yells could be heard. He hastened</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">his pace and walked on, pushing past hawkers and vendors selling their wares on the road. "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Bottle your XP here!</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>"... "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Selling birtch wood! Imported directly from the Northern continent...</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>". Nzucco pushed deeper into the crowd into the Grand Bazaar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>II.
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>The Augustan Grand Bazaar was busy, crowded and dusty, usual for a Saturday evening. All around Nzucco, people were jostling each other, checking shop chests, and bargaining on prices with the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"shopkeepers. One could find almost everything in such a place, everything from building materials to XP, to the more shady potion buisness which involved discreet deals in alleyways and large amounts of diamonds changing hands. Most of the shop chests had"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">their prices in iron. Mt Augusta wasn't a very rich city, after all.
Even though the Bazaar was crowded, it was not as bustling as it might have been a month prior. Most Augustans knew better than to get together in large groups, or to attract too much</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">attention. Terrorist attacks still happened almost daily "death circle", the area directly around Mt. Augusta's nether portal. Nzucco's memory was still fresh from time when, three days ago, an small HCF squad surrounded the Augustan Ministry of Commerce</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"and lit the building on fire, trapping dozens of office workers inside, slaying them if they attempted to escape. Nzucco knew it was better not to think of such things. He also tried to convince himself that he would never go out without a fight, although"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">in reality he knew he would probably come face to face with the red screen and the letters "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>You Died</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>" before he would know what was going on.
Finally he arrived in wool section and made his way towards the shop he recognized. As he got close, the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">shopkeeper lifted his head and beamed at him. "Eh! Oh! Nzucco! How's it going man?", he greeted. They slapped their fists together like old friends. "Good to see you again, ThierryTremblay. Can I come in?". The shopkeeper assented, and they both entered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">into the building.
Inside, it was dark. Thierry hit the lightswitch but nothing hapenned, and he swore under his breath. "Merde! Someone's probably messed with the redstone wiring again... Oh, it doesn't matter. Here NZ, take a chair". They both sat down.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Here, I made some this morning", said Thierry as he took a bottle out from a nearby chest and gave it to Nzucco. He identified the clearish opaque liquid as a speed potion.
"One of my paintings broke", grimaced Nzucco after downing the bottle. "I was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">hoping you'd have more white wool". Thierry nodded, but seemed preoccupied by something else.
"Say, you've heard the latest developments on the bannings? It's some pretty heavy shit, man". Nzucco looked up, perplexed. "I heard on the mumble that fucking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">RKWildCard himself is banned. Matticus suspects foul play". 
"No!"
"I swear to ttk2, I heard it just an hour ago. The talk stations are alight with it". Nzucco looked down. "That makes a whole lot of angry people, I suppose". Thierry pulled out a clock</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and glanced at the time. "Oula! It's already late afternoon, and I need to meet with my supplier to get the new arrivals of stock. How about we meet up later? ...What was it you wanted again? Ah yes..." his voice faded away as he entered another room, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the sound of a chest opening could be heard as he fetched wool. He came back with a smile on his face. "Here, this one's on the house, 'cause you're such a bro". He tossed the wool. "Thanks Theirry, I'll get back to you soon... I gotta go too". Nzucco</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">left the small supply hut and re-emerged into the outside world. Taking a right, he left the busy market and started to head home, wool in hand. As he walked home, he saw some graffiti on the side of a building. It read "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>The map reset is near-repent</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">

<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>III.
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>Nzucco awoke with a start. Suddenly awake, he layed still in his bed, listening. After a few seconds, he closed his eyes again but heard a distant yell from somewhere outside the appartment. Another yell</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">answered it, farther. Then, a few seconds later, a distant explosion. Nzucco shut his eyes tight and swore. "Not another fucking nightime raid". He sat up in his bed and looked around his darkened room. Silence for a while, then another yell, closer.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Getting up, slightly groggy, he went to the switch and flipped it. Nothing hapenned. Swearing again, he pushed open the door and walked towards his kitchen. The main room was bathed in dim moonlight from outside, so he could barely make out the shapes of "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">his furnature. Penetrating the kitchen, he tried the lightswitch there too which failed. Frustrated, he made his way to the window, and almost immediately jumped back when he saw what was hapenning outside of it. "Holy shit!". Smoke was pouring out of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"shop accross the street and flames were licking at the building. He stumbled back into the obscurity, stubbing his toe, just as another explosion, this one closer, rattled the building. Quickly, Nzucco went to the radio in the living room, fumbling with "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"knobs. The sound of static filled the room, and after trying a few different channels, without success, he shut the radio off. Edging his way back to his darkened room, he dressed up hastily in his armour and grabbed his sword; and then shifted the large "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"chest out of the way a bit to reveal a small, hidden, hollowed panel. Opening it, he carefully retrieved a few potions and an ender pearl from the cache and stuffed them in his pockets. He hurried out, left his appartment, and made his way to the empty "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">lobby. He tried the lobby lights with no success before making his way to the door and tentatively stepping outside.
The first thing that hit him was the acrid smell of burning wood. He was suddenly aware of people on the street, running in and out</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"of the shadows, yells coming from here and there. The streetlights were out too. Citywide outage, he thought. This is serious. Trying to stay hidden, he made his way towards the neighboring appartment block. From his vantage point, he could see a crowd of"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">people surrounding the burning shop down the road. They seemed to be looting it. "Jesus Christ", Nzucco muttered before slipping into the lobby.
He made out a small source of light, a torch fastened on the reception desk. Right as he took a step forward,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">he felt a hand reach out and grab his face. Panicking, he reached for his sword and tried to scream, before turning around and coming face to face with his assailant. The grip on his face relaxed, and his hand went away from his sword.
"Christ, Siriann",</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Nzucco gasped, recognizing his neighbor. "What the hell is going on?" Siriann was visibly shaken. "The... it's the god-damned hackers, they've covered 0,0 in diamond blocks, I... there's rioting everywhere, people are saying it's the end." Nzucco</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">swallowed forcefully. "What? The end of what? Of the map?"
"Maybe... I don't know, I just logged on and people were burning shit left and right- We have to get out of here". Siriann ran back to the lobby counter and grabbed a small box. "Do you have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">potions?" Nzucco felt through his pockets. "Yeah, I got a few.. not a lot, and my armour's shit." Siriann grabbed his arm and pushed him towards the door. "We'll have to stay hidden then. Come on. We have to get out of the city at all costs".
They exited</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"the lobby through a small side door, silently, swords drawn. As they stepped out into the crisp acrid night air, they saw the skyline of Mt. Augusta burning vividly in the night sky, the light of lava-covered skyscrapers radiating into the black night all"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">around. Fires were burning from all the neighborhoods, the smoke mingling and drifting in the night sky as an explosion obliterated the last three floors of the Trading Company building. Nzucco gasped. "Holy fucking shit". "I need to get my stuff-".</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Siriann cut him off. "Don't. They'll torch these blocks next. Don't even bother with the money, I don't think it means shit now..." The sound of glass breaking nearby made him suddenly freeze. "We need to get to a safe place at all costs.. I know a place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It's in North Side". Siriann moved away, and called after his friend. "C'mon NZ, let's go!". Nzucco shook his head and ran after Siriann as they jumped a fence and cut through some gardens.
After a while, they arrived at a larger road, where there was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">still some streetlights that were working. From their hidden vantage point, they could see a group of people gathered at a nearby intersection. They were surrounding someone who was tied up on the road, screaming and begging. "Quick", said Siriann, "Cross</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">on my mark". They both quickly sprinted accross the street undedected, as the begging scream became a scream of death and pain. Nzucco grimaced and ran faster.
At last, they jumped another fence and arrived into a small, deserted courtyard. Dawn was just</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">beginning to rise. "Hold up, let me check my map", said Siriann as he pulled a small paper from his pocket. He went to sit down at a bench while Nzucco looked off into the alleyway leading to a street, listening to the faraway yells and shouts. Suddenly,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">he saw a diamond-clad figure run in front of the alleyway. Then another. Running backwards he grabbed Siriann. "Quick!  Get inside... it's HCF!". They scrambled towards a store and tried the door, locked. Siriann grabbed a rock and smashed the window.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">They jumped inside and hit the ground just as the diamond-clad posse entered the courtyard, shouting. This time, there was no unified chant. "<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Get the fucking shops! We'll burn everything!</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>". Laughter followed. Then the sound of glass shattering, a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">torch being thrown. Siriann peeked out from their cover. "Wait a second.. I recognise some of them. They aren't HCF... holy shit, those guys are WP!" Nzucco sunk farther behind the shelves of canned goods and shut his eyes tight.
"<span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>It's the end."</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
