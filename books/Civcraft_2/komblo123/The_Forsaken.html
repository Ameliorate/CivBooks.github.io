<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 1: The unseeing man.

It was cold, hard to breath. I opened my eyes. Ice and snow as far as the eye could see.

"Where am I?" I spoke with a shiver.
"I don't remem..." My words were cut off</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">by a strange sound. I quickly scanned the area, it was too cold to turn my head, I forced my eyes around. And there I saw it.

"A person! I'm saved!" I said in excitement. As I forced my body to turn around, I tried to yell.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Help! Help! I need help!" Is what I tried to say, but my throat just wouldn't let the words out, my tongue couldn't even shape them.

Was I going to die here? Just a few metres away from being saved?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I looked at the person, I tried to stand up but my body was too cold, too damaged. 

The person suddenly started walking towards me. Did he see me? No, it's impossible in this fog. Is it just a coincidence? I thought to myself. Nontheless I was happy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I could feel myself fill with excitement. Then it all vanished. As he came closer I noticed something horrifying. Something so dreadfull I thought I was hallucinating. His skin, all green and rotten. It's almost as I could peel it off.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">His flesh was exposed in several areas, his eyes were... No, he had no eyes. His nose was still fine, is he using his sense of smell to get around? 

His brain was exposed, frozen, he had lost one of his arms, and icicle took it's place.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Then he suddenly started running. It was clear he was coming towards me, and was no savior. 

I paniced, unsure what to do I tried standing up, but to no avail.

"I'm done for" I said to myself. I accepted my fate.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 2: Salvation?

"Get off ye feet!" I heard in the distance. An arrow suddenly flew past me. The thing that was running for me was shot straight through it's head. It fell into the snow only to be buried again by snowflakes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"I said, GET OFF YE FEET!" The man said before pulling me along with him. I couldn't get a good look at him, but he had incredible arm strenght. 

My imagination started to run wild, in my mind he was a knight in shining armor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He is probably tall, well kept and incredibly athletic. He has to be right? Who else would be able to kill that thing, save me AND bring me with him?

Before I know it, he tosses me inside a igloo. He then buries the entry with snow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Oi! What are ye doin out ere!? Do ye want to get eat'n?" I turned around to look at him. I was dissapointed that my expectations were not met. He was average height, fat and covered in orange facial hair. His nose were the size of a plum.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I didn't care though, he saved me. I looked at him and smiled.

"OI! YE LISTENING!? Snap out of et!" He shouted. 

I wasn't really listening, I was more focused on warming my hands of the fire. The igloo wasn't big.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">But it could hold two more people. The fire Was surrounded by stones on every side. I guess that's how he keeps the igloo from melting. 

After a while of spacing out, I look at him and say "Thank you, you saved me. But, who are you?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Oh, so ye finally out of et? Well, names Pete, Pete Ruckerbergh. Was yer name?" He asked.

"Zam, Zam Pettersen."

"Well, can ye answer my question? What are ye doin out in the open?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"I... I don't know" I answered.

"I don't remember anything. I just woke up in the middle of a frozen field. Then I saw one of those things" I said anxiously.

"Ye mean the flesh eaters?" He said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Flesh eaters?" I jumped up from my comfortable and warm position. "Don't tell me, they eat humans?"

"Hah, dey eat just abut anythin dey can find. Yer nothing but dinner for em" He said with a slight chuckle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"So where did they come from?" I asked with a worried tone.

"We don know, but I'll bet mah grandmothers sunday pancakes that it's those damn crafters!"

Crafters? I remember that word, but the thought escaped my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">mind and I asked
"Where is it safe then, from those things?" 

"Well, de only place safe from em flesh eaters is in NDZ, and aye have a map! Look, I'll sho..." He stopped speaking, he started listening to the walls. "Dey've come" He said</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Quick! Tru ere!" He pointed at the ground. He took a shovel and stabbed it though the ground. It broke apart and revealed a tunnel.

"We need to hurry!" he said. 

Trusting my savior I follow him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"We need to cut thru da frozen city. It's bad part of town, awful, awful place. But right now we ain't got the luxury of choice"

After 30 minutes of walking, he punches his shovel through the frozen roof. We climb up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 3: The Frozen City.

I move the fur coat I got from Pete away from my face. I look up, huge buildings scraping the clouds, some fallen and all of them are frozen through a thick layer of ice topped off with snow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Dis be Arin, was a beatiful city once" Pete said with a nostalgic tone.

"What happened?" I asked

"Flesh eaters, took out half de population, the other half froze to death in the nuclear winter"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Crafters sacrifised de city to stop em flesh eaters. Thing is, when you die you turn into em." 

Shocked, unable to find an appropriate response I stand there in silence. I look around, the dead look of the city gives me a shiver.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"So did it work, the nukes?" I asked.

"For a while yea, but they just kept comin at et. Now dere huntin de surviors of Arin."

I press my coat against my skin, putting my hands together to warm them up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Let's check out dese build'ns, some of em still have stuff in em"

As we move through the dead, silent, frozen city. We check every building that isn't frozen solid. Pete has some sort of heat stick, which he puts into the keyholes and it melts the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">entire door open. I see a cord going from it to his blue backpack. I bet he has some sort of handmade generator in there. 

"Check de second floor will ye lad?"

I nod and go upstairs. The first thing I do is go into the bathroom</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to look for painkillers. The door is frozen but seems unstable. 

"If only I could find something to break it open with" I said.

I go into the bedroom and see a corpse, some glasses and a crowbar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The crowbar has "hl2" ingraved into it. 

"Jackpot" I whisper in excitement. I rub my hands together before picking it up. As I lift it, it is suprisingly heavy. Bet it smashes skulls pretty easily.

I go back to the bathroom door.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I lift the crowbar, then put all my force into a heavy strike. 

The door explodes into tiny little bits of wood with ice surrounding it. As I enter the bathroom I notice a mirror. My black hair was a bit messed up.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Did I grow taller since last time I checked?" Then I realize I don't remember ever checking a mirror before. I was tall, a stub for facial hair and a sleek face.

I open the cabinet, I find an empty box of pills. "No such luck"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I sigh. Suddenly I hear a bell ringing an extremely loud noise throughout the city. It sounded like an alarm. Then I hear Pete.

"OI ZAM! WE NEED TO GET MOVIN! AN ALARM WENT OFF, IT'S GOIN TO ATTRACT FLESH EATERS! GET MOVIN!" He yells.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I take the crowbar and go downstairs, the alarm gets louder and louder. It's just a matter of time before the city is swarmed with Flesh Eaters. 

As I run outside I see five of them surrounding Pete. They are all frozen and barely able to move.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He takes out his electric heat stick and wacks one in the head, creating an opening for him. 

"Follow me if ye wan to live!" 

I ran after Pete, I ran as fast as I could. I was suprised how fast Pete could run.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It has to be why he survived for this long. I kept running, but I couldn't keep going like this for long.

More and more Flesh Eaters swarm the city. They are in uncountable numbers. Pete signals me to follow him down a staircase.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He opens a door and lets me though.

"Aight, you gotta listn to me now mate, in yer condition, ya won't survive for long. Take me backpack and follow de map. Run through dis tunnel n' don stop. I'll hold off em Flesh Eaters.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">"Wow, you can't sacrifise youself for me" I said right before he cut me off

"No one's sacrifising anyone aight? I'm just maken sure you make it. I'll meet ye by Orion West station. Don stop, and don look de shadows in dey eyes!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He runs off before I could question him. What did he mean by the shadows? I started to run down the tunnel when I notice I am in an abondoned Metro Station. Broken railway tracks and rats mostly inhibit these.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Chapter 4: The Dark Tunnel

Some of the lights were still working in the tunnel. Mostly emergency lights. But whenever I find a proper metro light I stop for a few minutes to admire it. "It's so bright" I said to myself.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I then remember I shouldn't waste time, what if Pete didn't make it? What if the Flesh Eaters are coming for me next? I shrug and pick up my backpack. When I started moving I hear a rustling sound from the backpack. "Oh yeah, what is inside it anyway?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I opened Pete's backpack. It's filled with rotten food, some adult magazines and a small hand operated generator connected to a metal stick. "Shit, the cords are broken" I said with an annoyed tone. It seems some of the Flesh Eaters must have cut the cord</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to Pete's weapon when we started running. I look a bit deeper into the backpack. "Wow, maybe luck exists afterall?" I said to myself whilst grinning as I pick up the flashlight. I try to turn it on, but it's dead. "Hmmm" I suddenly got an idea.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I could put the secondary cord from the generator right into the battery for the flashlight. With a bit of hope and excitement, I push the cord in. "It fits!" I accidentally shout. Hopefully no one's around to hear me. I start to push the clamp to power</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the flashlight. It emits a bright yellow beam. I use it look at the ground. Then I notice there's hundreds, no THOUSANDS of dead rats lying everywhere. "What happened here?" I said to myself in panic. They all seem untouched, but liveless. It couldn't be</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Flesh Eaters. There's no bite marks, no sign of struggle. It just seem like the rats all dropped dead at the same time. Judging by the amount and the direction they where facing, it seems like they ran away from something, and that something is the same</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">way I need to go. I double check my map, "There's supposed to be a checkpoint up ahead, but I don't see any lights." 

I keep walking forward, avoiding the dead rats as I walk. The dripping sound of the celing accompanies my footsteps.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I continue walking down the tunnel, only stopping to regain my stamina and using the clamp on the generator. After another hour of walking, I see the checkpoint. All the light seem are off, even the emergency lights. "Weird, they aren't broken" I said</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">The lights are simply unpowered, did the generator break? No, impossible. The emergency light work using chemicals. They only stop working when in contact with oxygen, but they are still sealed. It looked like they all just turned off.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">As I approached the checkpoint's centre. I noticed something weird. There were tons of beds, food, weapons and resources, all untouched. "Where did the people who lived here go?" Soon it would all become clear to me.

To Be Continued...</div></div>
