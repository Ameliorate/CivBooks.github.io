It is worth noting however, that if used in the manner of an infantryman, the horsemen will not be effective.

It is important to distiguish between the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"two types of horsmen: Cavalry and Mounted Infantry. While they both make use of the horse, only calvary fights on horseback. Mounted infantry instead ride to thier intended position, dismount, and fight on foot. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 17</a><div class="page-content">CALVARY
Calvary use the superior mobility of the horse as a tactical advantage. It should be noted that calvary is only effective on relatively smooth, dry terrain, as the horse can not as easily tranverse water or hills as the footman.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"The bow is of particular importance to calvary. Unlike infantry, a skilled calvaryman may fire without slowing down. However, the horse cannot move backward or to the side quickly. This means that the calvary will either be nearly stationary while firing,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 17</a><div class="page-content">or approaching the enemy. This means that an equal force of Regular infantry can defeat calvary in most circumstances. 

Calvary should therefore only be used to engage bowless infantry, or infantry that is already in disarray.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 17</a><div class="page-content">"While their viable targets are limited, the calvary charge can make short order of said targets. It is important to remember that while the shock of impact is the essense of the charge, the bow should be used up until the moment contact is made. This "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 17</a><div class="page-content">firing charge is the true power of the calvary, to not make use of it is the hieght of folly.

Some armies do not practice discipline, but rather function as a mob of independant soldiers. Then enter the battle already is disarray. A calvary</div></div>

Even a properly disciplined army can be engaged by calvary</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 17</a><div class="page-content">but the army must first be thrown into disarray. The best way to do this is a frontal infantry assault. The calvary may then break, and then wipe out the enemy with a charge to the flank.

The role of the calvary is attack. If they must be used</div></div>

Selection of hourses is of the utmost importance. The desirability of speed is debateable. While the advantages of speed</div></div>

However, whatever speed is selected, it must be adopted uniformly by all calvarymen. Non-uniform speed will result in ragged formations, and thus "</div></div>

Mounted infantry seek to combine the tactical advantages of infantry with the strategic advantages of calvary. Mounted infantry work extremely will in tandem with calvary, as they provide the infantry core calvary need, while allowing</div></div>

Mounted infantry should dismount before reaching the battle site, at which point they will function as Regulars. The use of high-grade horses, or any horse armor at</div></div>

While their horses should have comperable speeds, as the slowest horse will determine the speed of the entire regiment, true uniformity is not necessary as it is with calvary.

It may be tempting to use mounted infantry as makeshift calvary. Do not. They will most likely have thier horses shot out from under them and</div></div>
