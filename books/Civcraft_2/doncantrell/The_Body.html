The cloths of the body it did stain. As she let out her final cry of pain. The spirit from her body did depart. As heer frail limbs came apart. "</div></div>

Her hair did all break away. As her skin did all decay. It did form her necks last noose. And her fingers all came lose. "</div></div>

Hope this didn\u0027t freak you out too much. It\u0027s just this server\u0027s version of Eger Allen Poe. Yea, spelling doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s just a bourgious principal anyway. So long comrades."</div></div>
