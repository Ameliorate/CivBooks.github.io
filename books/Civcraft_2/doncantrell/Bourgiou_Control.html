We are forced to abide by their customs. We are forced by the capitolistic societies to abide by what the societies call manners. They as well force the Proletariate to follow customs in their</div></div>

They don't allow comrades to release their creativity in every way. In this the bougiousi restrains the creativity of the Proletariate. They intend to oppress the workers</div></div>

They force us to think like they do; in terms of money and power. They do this by forcing their culture upon all of us. By doing this they eleminate resistance by the Proletariate to their way of</div></div>

They think that by absorbing us in their way of life, they will put in bondage our ideas and our pride in the working class of the nations. The great class by wich nations are built. For nations are build by the hands of</div></div>

They know that with free thinking, we will realize the power which they hold over us. They fear that the workers of the world will recognize the oppression they are</div></div>

And by doing that, they feal that they can restrain the great and mighty revolution by the Proletariate. Under their laws we are forced to live. Under their customs is our creativity held in bondage. For now only poets know true</div></div>

That is why it is our duty to tell the Bourgiousi that they do not controle us. It is time to tell them that their way of thinking does not dominate our minds. For our minds are the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">great minds of the world's workers. We can only defeat the Bourgiousi if we stand up for our own opinions and our own way of doing things. We can't continue to live like this. We must stand. I repeat! WE MUST STAND!!! Failure means slavery! Victory means</div></div>
