For those not familiar with the LADS conflict going on at the time of this writing, I will briefly summarize it. If you are familiar, you may skip ahead until the red marker. You will not miss it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">At the time of this writing, as you may already know, comrades, a conflict about justice is going on in the Civcraft world. An organization called LADS, who are defense contractors who will defend cities, but they do whatever
they like with the pearls.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"LADS rules from a city called Duck City, which is entirely private. Entering Duck City will get you pearled without question. With their brutal arrogance and occasional unjustified violence, LADS, born from what was seen as a good idea, became unpopular."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"A militia of proletariat and bourgeoisie alike attacked Duck City, and many mored simply came to spectate the chaos that followed. Ultimately, in the battle, LADS was victorious, pearling militia and spectators alike, many of whom escaped."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>(END OF SUMMARY
FOR POSTERITY)
</span></span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This, comrades, is where we, as thinking workers of the world, must draw our conclusions. The LADS began attacking cities where they were both legal and authorized, and forbidden, and attacked not only people that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">were present at duck city, but even people who "Helped" them. They have, in essence, become little more than a group of bandits. Where did this good idea, a militia to defend Civcraft should they hire them, the natural Ancap way of doing things, go wrong?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Was it with the cities that gave them room to grow? Was it with the militia that provoked LADS? Did LADS turn to the dark side when they left Duck City and the cities they were authorized to fight in? <span class="fmtm"><span class="fmtcode">§m</span>Was it with Capitalist pigdogs?</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> The answer,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"comrades, is <span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>none of the above.</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span> The problem started with the system, with Anarcho-Capitalism and the essentially governmentless cities that resemble Survival Multi-player than a true, Marx-Leninist society, or even a decent state at all."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"In a capitalist system, the bourgeoisie class profits off of their sales. And when the company is a mercenary band like LADS, those sales are war, griefers, and pearlings. Any capitalist will ignore ethics for their own gain."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 14</a><div class="page-content">By nature, these private defense forces are driven to corruption by these perverse incentives. Without a state military operated by the proletariat, there can only be violence as a group of trigger happy PvPers "get bored". They abuse their power.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Comrades, what can be done about this? The only reasonable answer left is to abolish the system entirely. We cannot let private indivuals and companies driven by the interests of the bourgeoisie decide the security and fate of the proletariat."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"The only reasonable way for cities to defend themselves is to cut out the middlemen and protect themselves and eachother with their own militaries made of the citizens. We must act in our own interests. Alliances, not capitalism, is the key."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"By now, I would hope the reader sees the problems evident with capitalist defense. LADS\u0027 actions were inevitable. Equality, not imbalance, is the key. We workers should control our own fates. Does this sound like a familiar idea, comrade?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"It is time to turn the scales and defend ourselves against our oppressors. Come to New Leningrad, comrades. United, we can defend ourselves better than any corporations. MrGerbic of LADS even pearled Zombie Lenin way back. What sorta asshole does that?"</div></div>
