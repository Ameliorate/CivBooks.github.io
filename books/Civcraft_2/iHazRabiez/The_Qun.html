<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Long ago, the Ashkaari lived in a great city by the sea. Wealth and prosperity shone upon the city like sunlight, and still its people grumbled in discontent.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The Ashkaari walked the streets of his home and saw that all around him were the signs of genius: triumphs of architecture, artistic masterpieces, the palaces of wealthy merchants, libraries, and concert halls.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 18</a><div class="page-content">But he also saw signs of misery: the poor, sick, lost, frightened, and the helpless. And the Ashkaari asked himself, “How can one people be both wise and ignorant, great and ruined, triumphant and despairing?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 18</a><div class="page-content">So the Ashkaari left the land of his birth, seeking out other cities and nations, looking for a people who had found wisdom enough to end hopelessness and despair.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 18</a><div class="page-content">He wandered for many years through empires filled with palaces and gardens, but in every nation of the wise, the great, the mighty, he found the forgotten, the abandoned, and the poor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Finally, he came to a vast desert, a wasteland of bare rock clawing at the empty sky, where he took shelter in the shadow of a towering rock, and resolved to meditate until he found his answer or perished.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Many days passed until one night, as he gazed out from the shadow of the rocks, he saw the lifeless desert awaken.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 18</a><div class="page-content">A hundred thousand locusts hatched from the barren ground, and as one, they turned south, a single wave of moving earth.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 18</a><div class="page-content">The Ashkaari rose and followed in their wake: a path of devastation miles wide, the once verdant land turned to waste. And the Ashkaari's eyes were opened.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Existence is a choice.
There is no chaos in the world, only complexity.
Knowledge of the complex is wisdom.
From wisdom of the world comes wisdom of the self.
Mastery of the self is mastery of the world. Loss of the self is the source of suffering.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Suffering is a choice, and we can refuse it.

It is in our power to create the world, or destroy it.
And the Ashkaari went forth to his people.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 18</a><div class="page-content">       End of Canto I</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 18</a><div class="page-content">When the Ashkaari looked upon the destruction wrought by locusts,
He saw at last the order in the world.
A plague must cause suffering for as long as it endures,
Earthquakes must shatter the land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 18</a><div class="page-content">They are bound by their being.
Asit tal-eb. It is to be.
For the world and the self are one.
Existence is a choice.
A self of suffering, brings only suffering to the world.
It is a choice, and we can refuse it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 18</a><div class="page-content">       End of Canto II</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Doubt is the path one walks to reach faith. To leave the path is to embrace blindness and abandon hope. To call a thing by its name is to know its reason in the world. To call a thing falsely is to put out one's own eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 18</a><div class="page-content">Shok ebasit hissra. Meraad astaarit, meraad itwasit, aban aqun. Maraas shokra. Anaan esaam Qun. 

(Struggle is an illusion. The tide rises, the tide falls, but the sea is changeless. There is nothing to struggle against. Victory is in the Qun.)</div></div>
