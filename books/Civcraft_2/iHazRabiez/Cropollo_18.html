And as there is but one life, and one death, there was one Peasant. And as light must have dark, heat must have cold, the peasant had to have... a noblman. Soon, the peasant and noblman multiplied, ruining the cycle."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 10</a><div class="page-content">"The noblman\u0027s children, the noblmen, oppressed the peasants. But the peasants served dutifully. Over time, the peasants became more than simple farmers. They became complex farmers. They learned to build. They wielded the power of their forefathers."</div></div>
