So the Tree shed bark from its mighty trunk and from its matter, formed the dirt of the earth. The Tree saw that the world was dry, so it</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   The Holy Tree looked to its creation and saw it lush and verdant, but without a being to truly appreciate the earth’s glory. From deep within the the Trees branches was released a divine man, The Grand Lorax.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 31</a><div class="page-content">so the Mighty Tree sent out a flurry of apples which fell to the earth and cracked, from the seed of these apples came humankind.

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   With these believers, the Lorax created the town of Holy Tree. The town became a city and the city grew stronger still with the blessings of the Great Tree</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span> <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In the first days of the Holy City, came a messenger who spoke of a powerful empire to the West and of it’s will and purpose. Quickly, the Chosen discussed the possibilities. Some looked to the Empire for guidance and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 31</a><div class="page-content">others feared it’s might. The Empire seeked to bring Holy Tree within its grasp with sweet words and brazen promises.
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   All paled when the Empire stated their intentions, the conversion of Holy Tree to a heathen faith. All except the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 31</a><div class="page-content">"Lorax. He saw the strength of the Empire and their threat to the people of the nation. He accepted the offer. Believing in his heart and soul that despite the attempts of the heretics to convert the lands of the Tree, the people would remain true. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 31</a><div class="page-content">But the will of the Tree was to take a different path.
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   Time passed, and with the goading of the Empire, the Monuments to the Tree changed colour and the people of Holy Tree lurched into ferocious debate over the faith. The bark of unity</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 31</a><div class="page-content">cracked under the heat of debate, then broke completely when the chosen willingly laid down the lash of words to pick up the cold hilt of a sword.

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   As the Empire laughed, the town of Holy Tree tore at itself. Brother struck brother as those</div></div>

<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   The Tree looked to the nature it had created, full of power untapped, present even in the cities of the heathen. As the people of the Great Tree could no longer fight the menace</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 31</a><div class="page-content">required attention from the walls of the City of the Chosen. 
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   Speaking to those who followed him he proclaimed the next step in his mission,
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>“Hear me Chosen! Though prosperous we have become under the shade of the Tree, spreading the word</div></div>

My sin weighs heavy on my soul and the knowledge that war and strife beset those who can not hear the whispers of the Tree taunts my conscience."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 31</a><div class="page-content">I must leave Holy Tree to begin to amend the wrongs I brought to the world, to spread the word in the silence and bring light to the darkness. It is the will of the Tree that the world shall know its creator!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 31</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   As the Lorax turned to leave his people the wind rustled the leaves of the many tree shrines and hearing the leaves whisper together the Chosen became aware of their duties. 
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>“We too shall spread the word! The burden of the Lorax is the burden of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 31</a><div class="page-content">us all! The world will know unity!” 
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmtcode">§r</span>   So it was that as the Lorax left the Chosen and the Chosen left Holy Tree. With word of mouth and ancient texts the people who still lived without the gifts of the Tree would become aware of their Creator.</div></div>
