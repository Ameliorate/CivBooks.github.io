<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">to return the items and prevent future misunderstandings.

After this a lull fell over the town.  Avalo continued his daily farming and put the town into caretaker status, waiting for the possible return of his townsmen.  During this time the Jungle Farm</div></div>
