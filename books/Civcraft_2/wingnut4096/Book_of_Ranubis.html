It is based of the fact that Ra and Anubis are the only true gods and that together, they created the Earth. Without the Sun, the Earth never would have existed, and without the Earth's</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 8</a><div class="page-content">resources, life would be impossible. Because of this we steeds worship Ra, the god of the sun, and Anubis, god of the underworld and the Earth.

You may ask yourself, why does the caged bird sing? The answer is let's get back on topic.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">You may also ask yourself, why do we combine Ra and Anubis? Well, the answer to that question is not so straight forward. In the year 146 C.E., the great prophet Peter Fletcher had a vision of the future. Today we call this vision the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Revelation of Ranubis. This prophecy speaks of a day when the two gods Ra and Anubis will combine into one essence, the Holy One Ranubis. The problem is, why and how do we know that this vision is truthful? The reason why is quite simple. Through many</div></div>

The two are bound to be combined.

When debating with a</div></div>

Well let me ask you, do "scientists" have proof for their theories? Do they have proof for their proof? Do they have proof for their proof for their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 8</a><div class="page-content">proof? NO. Checkmate, scientific astro-losers.

When debating with a follower of a false religion, like the Cult of Cthulu, the flaw in their arguments are quite obvious. Their religion is based of belief, not evidence.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 8</a><div class="page-content">Though there is much more to Ranubism than can be explained within a man or woman's attention span during a single sitting, what is presented in this Holy Book is sufficient for study in order to become a follower of the Holy One.
