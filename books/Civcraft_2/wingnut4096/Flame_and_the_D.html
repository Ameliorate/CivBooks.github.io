It had seemed like a good place to start my new life, comfortable as the lap of an exotic stripper after a long day\u0027s work. I had escaped there after Danzilona had been ravaged by Twiggy and his boys, they had left nothing but ash and memories of"</div></div>

I had been in Lubeck for maybe a week, and that\u0027s when it all began. We\u0027d been frolicking in the fields without a care in the world, and then Gouda went a bit too far- his fist plummeted into flameinginger\u0027s brain like a thousand"</div></div>

His lifeless body fell to the ground, leaving nothing but a pile of tools and armor. All I could do was watch and then walk away. The next morning I awoke with flame's voice in my head. "You took the pick, didn't you?" the voice whispered.</div></div>

He was stubborn, but then again, most gingers are. He demanded reps. I didn\u0027t have any time for his shit, and couldn\u0027t pay anyway. I stalled him as long as I could, but it wasn\u0027t "</div></div>

As my life flowed out, he sucked my soul into a shiny, black pearl and the next thing I knew I woke up on a hard white rock looking into a hazy black sky. The End. I\u0027d been here"</div></div>
