<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Emmit was the first to live on The Rocks.

He named them The Rocks because that is what they were: 

a group of sharp rocks clustered together in the middle of a large sea.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 42</a><div class="page-content">This was where Emmit lived; he enjoyed his life.

Emmit would occasionally swim to nearby rocks, as it was never too far of a distance.

One day another person appeared on The Rocks for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 42</a><div class="page-content">no apparent reason to Emmit.

Emmit named this person, Branch.

Emmit and Branch quickly became friends, swimming and hunting for fish together often.

Emmit showed</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Branch the simple cave in which he lived on the largest rock.

Soon, Branch discovered a place where he decided to live, also on the same rock. 

The sun always shone brightly in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 42</a><div class="page-content">their world, and the water was always dazzlingly clear, allowing them to see almost to the deep ocean floor which surrounded them.

Though the sun always shone, it was never too hot for the boys.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">A light breeze always came from the north and cooled the area down.

One day while Branch was swimming and having fun in the water he noticed another boy swimming.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Branch brought the new boy to Emmit to find out what to call the new boy.

Emmit said the boy should be called Will.

Will was soon a part of the group and all three of the boys swam and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 42</a><div class="page-content">enjoyed their perfect world.

At least, that is the story I was told when I arrived today on the island.

Emmit, Branch, and Will were surprised to see me at first, but even before the night ended we</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 42</a><div class="page-content">we all becoming good friends.

Today, the second day on this newly created age, a strange thing happened.

It was not strange to me, but the three boys did not understand what</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 42</a><div class="page-content">was happening.

While I was relaxing under a large tree on one of the smaller rock islands, it began to rain.

It was a nice rain that lasted for about an hour in the morning.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I explained to the boys that the rain was not harmful, yet they obviously still feared it. 

Before going to sleep tonight I told the boys I would leave the following day. 

I told them that</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">while I was gone, I would make a surprising change in their world. 

They didn’t understand (not that I expected them to).

I still do not fully understand what happened today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I was
experimenting with The Art - testing the limits of the rules as dictated to me by Father.

I attempted to create a boat by writing it into the world. 

I thought</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">everything was planned correctly, yet somehow the boat had become gripped by the rock and broken in half. 

Although this test did not turn out as I had hoped, I now have answers to a few of the questions my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">father never answered.

As for the boat, I can see the boys enjoy it anyway and with that I am pleased. 

They have played on it all day.

Even though the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">boat cannot move I have enjoyed studying form it. 

It is a much sturdier platform than the jagged rocks. 

In the course of my observations I have learned some very interesting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">things regarding the star system of this age.

The nights are absolutely beautiful here. 

I have made note of and named a number of constellations that pass above me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Also during the night, I catch glimmers of light from the horizon which I have not been able to discover if it is created by some natural phenomenon or by additional people on far off islands or rocks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">I should very much like to discover which (I rather suspect it is additional people, which would explain the appearance of Branch and Will).

The rain today was slightly heavier than usual.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Just when the boys were getting used to the light rains, a small storm arrived. 

They were frightened of the heavier rain, not to mention the thunder and lightning. 

If rain has never</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">fallen here until recently, as the boys tell me, I would like to discover why it is falling now.

Regardless, I have decided to return home for a short while. 

I have also been thinking  of some</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 42</a><div class="page-content">plans for a lighthouse that I hope to construct soon. 

I think that perhaps by shining a bright light toward the horizon, it might prove my suspicions regarding additional</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 42</a><div class="page-content">inhabitants. 

They would be curious about the light and try to discover its source - if they have the means.

I returned with many tools that I will need for construction of</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">the lighthouse. 

I have decided that once the lighthouse is completed I will leave for some time and let the world’s own imagination have control.

We have worked three weeks on the lighthouse now,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 42</a><div class="page-content">and are making great progress.

The rock that we are building on seems to not be as secure as I would like.

I have had to alter my plans slightly, but those alterations pose</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 42</a><div class="page-content">no real problem.

The boys are quite strong and have been helping me immensely.

I estimate construction will be done within two days.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 42</a><div class="page-content">The lighthouse is finished and we are all proud of our creation. 

The boys are amazed at the structure wrought from rock with their own hands. 

That evening we powered up the</div></div>

I stayed the night in the top of the lighthouse and in the morning awoke to observe the sunrise without my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">being coated with the chilly blanket of ocean dew I had become accustomed to.

It was Will who first saw the girl. She was swimming not far from the boat where Will was getting ready to hunt for fish.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Then Will noticed a man not far away from the girl. 

Emmit was very pleased to meet the additional neighbors.

I feel pleased to leave this age - I have set in motion events that have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 42</a><div class="page-content">nothing to do with writing or The Art, that will have a more profound impact on this world than I could ever have written. 

I think of it this age as a gift to myself that I will wrap up and open someday in the future, only</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">to discover that it has changed so much that indeed it is a surprise.

Besides, I have yet another new age that awaits me. 

It seems I’m going to need some way to travel underwater in this new age,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 42</a><div class="page-content">and so much planning is in order.

It has been 10 years since I left this age, which I have since called The Stoneship Age. 

Upon returning I can not believe the changes that have</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">taken place. 

The original 3 “boys” have grown into adults, and there are many new faces that I do not recognize.

Branch told me that it has not rained for seven years and the cool</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">breezes are back again.

They are all very content and have been serving me with new foods and showing me new materials they have discovered. 

It even seems they have found gold</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 42</a><div class="page-content">somewhere; I see it in many forms around the island.

My lighthouse has been kept in perfect condition and it looks as if they have tried their very best to keep it so. 

Yet I have noted</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 42</a><div class="page-content">that the entire rock it was built on has sunk approximately 40 or 50 centimeters.

After a wonderful visit with my old friends, I wonder aloud with them what things will be like here in another 10 years.</div></div>
