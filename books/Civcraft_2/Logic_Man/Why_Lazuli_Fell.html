Originally prided as the 'garden city of Civcraft', Lazuli is a large, abandoned region located in the (+,-) quadrant of the 1.0 map.

It was founded by SomethingSaucy not long after the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 19</a><div class="page-content">demise of the nearby historic city of Rift.

The city was named after the extensive Lapis Lazuli vein that was found beneath its territory by early settlers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 19</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span> Introduction
</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
Within the same week that Columbia's government disintegrated, both of the server's most populous cities collapsed, casting doubts by many on the wisdom of settling in a city at all. But while</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 19</a><div class="page-content">the city of Columbia had frequently been the center of drama and scandal, Lazuli had always maintained a stable and peaceful existence.

It's sudden abandonment came as a surprise to many.</div></div>

</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
The mystery behind the almost overnight exodus of citizens from the Rpublic is attributable to several causes:

The first of these was the restriction placed on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 19</a><div class="page-content">travellers meaning to trade with the city. 

Lazuli's dead- locked portal had players (both domestic and foreign) repeatedly trapped inside the portal room, with no means of escape save</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 19</a><div class="page-content">for returning to the nether. 

This irritated both those trying to access the city, and those who had the permissions to open the gates (as these players were endlessly running back and forth to let travellers in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 19</a><div class="page-content">or out).

The second warning sign was a combination of a scarcity of land available (due to the physical limitations of the city wall, the time-consuming development of subdivisions to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 19</a><div class="page-content">meet demand and the monopoly that the municipal government had on selling land) and an increasingly vocal 'homeowners association' attitude towards newer residents from older residents.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 19</a><div class="page-content">This was particularly obvious from those who percieved that inferior buildings were being constructed next to their more expensive properties.

The collapse of Columbia is seen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 19</a><div class="page-content">as the catalyst for change on the server, and indeed the catalyst for migration out of Lazuli.

Cities were not the safe haven's they once were and with their leader's bogged down in political disputes,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 19</a><div class="page-content">positive upheavel was nigh- impossible.

A nostalgia for the open country with no restrictions and no irritable neighbours became the new trend.

Such social movement took six</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 19</a><div class="page-content">months to reverse - sadly far too late for the once great Republic of Lazuli.

Eerily empty, the future of Lazuli now lies in the hands of time itself.
