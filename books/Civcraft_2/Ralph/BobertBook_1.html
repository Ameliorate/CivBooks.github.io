The first 2 months are not written down day by day but I'll try to explain everything that happened. It started off back in early November 2014 when I joined</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 25</a><div class="page-content">CivCraft. I had to travel 10,000 blocks to arrive in Weldon the inactive town owned by asmko and esmth. I joined and no one was on so I picked a location for my house and began the building of the bridge that led to Casa de Bobert. A day later Umad84</div></div>

Later on that week I finished my house and began working on improving the town which only had 4 houses, a wheat farm, a small potato farm, and some roads and bridges connecting them. By the next week the player drinkable_solids had</div></div>

The week after that I invited CodeShort, BlueXerox, ItsKevinIrony, and littleclone who brought his brother GuyFieriFan. All of them built there houses and played for the next week until littleclone and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">his brother suddenly stopped playing. At this point I was still the only really active player with the others coming on once every other day maybe. Around this time the player Jen076 arrived in town along with Cosmic_Bagel coming a bit before her. Cosmic</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">brought dhorg with him who inturn invited a few people such as mooseman. All of these people became inactive within the week and Cosmic Bagel had finished the aboveground part of his build called Silf Co. Later on ItsKevinIrony was given a bastion by</div></div>

We also became good allies with the leader of Iria - wolfeyes391 as he had been in the Corum Alliance with Weldon before Weldon</div></div>

Many things were built during all these times such as the expanded tree farm, the watch tower, CircleShop, the windmill, and the Underground Complex. Around</div></div>

CodeShort was slain by drinkable_solids without placing a bed and was forced to walk all the way back to Weldon again. A week after this event CodeShort</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">killed BlueXerox and threatened to keep all his stuff. I then took it upon myself to kill CodeShort and return Blue's stuff and through Blue's rage, CodeShort's bed was destroyed and he was sent back to spawn again and has yet to return to Weldon. Days</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">after this ItsKevinIrony burnt down some trees in Weldon and was pearled for a few hours and during this time Blue jacked his items and Kevin decided to quit playing. I almost forgot the banning of drinkable_solids for xray. This happened</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">and triggered the banning of Jen076 due to the fact that drinkable accessed her account once to get her to Weldon as it was her first time on Minecraft.

Met lyony4 offered him citizenship in Weldon which he accepted to which means we now have a district 500 blocks away from the rest of the town which I am building a path to today.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">1/28/15:
Lost interest in Civ for a few weeks. I'm back now though. The new district of Weldon has disolved since I left and we were attacked by one griefer who ended up payting reps right away.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">1/30/15:
Work has started up again on the canal project and SwampGoat created a huge wheat auto farm. With my help we both converted the existing one into an auto farm as well giving us an abudance of wheat growing</div></div>

Had a huge argument
which ended with me stopping people because they were using my armor to kill people and I stopped them. Now we are majorly communist so no one argues - Great</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 25</a><div class="page-content">2/14/15:
Today we had to solve the case of p0tat07's train station grief and he managed to pay reps easily as it was a very small grief but still I'm glad to have him back. Also ItsKevinIrony and Jen076 got enchanted stuff.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 25</a><div class="page-content">2/15/15:
