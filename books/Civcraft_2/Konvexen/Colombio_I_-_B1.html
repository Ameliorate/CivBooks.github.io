<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Richard had been quiet for too long. He had to speak up. And he was going to tomorrow.
As he made his way down the darkened halls to his study, Richard heard a noise. Was it just the thunder? Yes. Yes, just the thunder. He continued</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 33</a><div class="page-content">shadow at the opposite end of the room, it was quiet. Even when he saw the faint muzzle flash, everything was quiet. And as he fell to the ground, bleeding, all was quiet.
It was 4 a.m. as Detective Jimmy McAdams stumbled back into his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 33</a><div class="page-content">apartment. He had been drinking again. He was breaking the custody agreement by doing that. Sarah wouldn’t let him see the kids if he didn’t pass the weekly alcohol test. And it was Friday.
But it was just one of those nights, a dark depressing night.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It was okay if he had a few beers. Or nine. He could stop whenever he needed to. Jimmy got into bed but before he could drift away into drunken bliss, his phone rang.
“Yeah what is it?” He answered.
“It’s Richard, Jim. He’s dead.” It was commissioner</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Williams.
“Christ,” Jimmy breathed. “Murdered?”
“Shot three times. One in the chest, two in the back of the head.”
“Where? The manor?”
“Yeah. We just got here. Look Jim, if you don’t want-“
“I’ll be there,” He said as he hung up the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 33</a><div class="page-content">phone.
Jimmy was often criticized for being a straight cop. In a city like Columbia, it was customary for cops to look the other way for general P distribution, and to take bribes from the crime families. It was all in equilibrium, the only losers in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"the deal were the actual Columbian citizens who were constantly under fear of the law enforcement, the criminals, and even the politicians. But Jimmy thought he could improve the system. At least at first. The only thing that kept him"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 33</a><div class="page-content">straight was his old partner, Bunk was also clean. But he died, meaning Jimmy had to be the clean one. And what a fucking joy that was.
Jimmy had always considered Commissioner Williams to be a decent guy and a good friend. But he suspected</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">he was on several dirty politicians’ payroll. Not that unusual.
Jimmy arrived at the manor a quarter before 5 in the morning. Still dark. Still raining. Williams and Detective Arnold McGinnis greeted Jimmy as he got to the door. McGinnis was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"one of the more obvious dirty cops. Press had already got there. Multiple police cars blocked the roads near the square, the red and blue lights seemed to hit every darkened corner of the sinful city. This was going to be a cluster fuck in the morning,"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Jimmy thought.
The three of them walked through the hallways, paintings of old men staring down at them. They reached the study where several other officers stood taking pictures of the scene. Richard had spent much time in the study, but by the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"look of the amount of dust, he hadn’t used it in a while. Jimmy and Richard shared many laughs and beers in that room. Now it was a dusty tomb, with Richard Hamilton lying face down in a heap, blood covering the wood flooring underneath him. The back"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">of his head had two chunks missing. Jimmy rolled over on his side to see the first hit, a couple of inches beneath the heart. Richard’s eyes had rolled back by this point, leaving a ghostly stare at Jimmy.
“He was standing when the first hit got</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">him. Looks like the gunman was standing over there, in front of the window waiting for him,” Jimmy started.
“How do you know that? He could’ve followed him in,”
“If he had followed he could’ve just shot him once in the head. The chest shot</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"shows that the gunman didn’t want to risk missing a headshot since it was dark and he was on the opposite end of the study,” It was a rather large study. “Then to make sure he was dead, the two shots to the back of the head after he had fallen down."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Pretty typical assassination. Any prints pulled yet?”
The Commissioner spoke up, “Place is clean. Whoever did this is a pro. Knew what he was doing, that’s for sure.”
“Okay. McGinnis, look through past cases for two shots to the back of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">victim’s head,” Jimmy ordered.
McGinnis looked at him begrudgingly but then went off. The Commissioner and Jimmy stood a while longer in silence. “I didn’t ever think Richard would be the type to get involved in the mafia,” Williams said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">
He wasn’t and Jimmy knew that. But why? For political reasons? Richard was opposed to the current regime, but it’s not like he could do anything. Richard’s pull in Columbian politics dwindled around the time of the failed justice systems</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">reform. It could be an old rival, Jimmy thought. But even that seemed a stretch. Political rivals stopped killing each other a long time ago, opting for the more ‘refined’ approach of slandering during public forums.
Maybe Richard</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">found something out. Something big.
“Maybe,” Jimmy said. “Was anything removed from the manor recently?”
“Not by us. Not yet anyway.”
Jimmy started looking around the room. He looked though the history section. Various tomes on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"the cities of Rift and Cressmopolis dotted the shelf. Jimmy had always known Richard had a fascination with early AnCap cities. More recent works were on the other shelves, still covered in dust however. “The Lazuli-Jack War” was a bestseller, though"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"it looked like Richard hadn’t even once looked through it. But then another book caught his eye. This one wasn’t as dusty, and the dust hadn’t settled as much as it had on the other ones. Richard had obsessed over this book, it seemed. It was called"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">“The Ancap Conspiracy: The Failed Lazuli Coup.” Richard wasn’t normally into conspiracy fiction, so this was odd. Jimmy took it off the shelf and slid it into his bag.
Back at home, Jimmy opened up the book. The sun had risen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"about an hour ago, but Jimmy wasn’t tired. He could sleep later. The book was written about three years ago by Nathaniel of Lazuli. He’d need to contact Nathaniel if this proved interesting. All this was odd to Jimmy, The Lazulian Republic and"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">"Columbia had never had much interest in each other, so why would Richard, a Columbian to the bone, have a book on Lazulian politics? He popped it open anyways."</div></div>
