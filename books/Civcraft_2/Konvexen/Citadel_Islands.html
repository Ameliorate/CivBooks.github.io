<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Introduction

The Citadel Complex itself is neither old nor new in terms of the server. But the land it occupies has seen some history. There are three main islands in the area, each with its own unique history</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">I. Main Island

The main island, what I call "Citadel Island," was originally found my NateMagic, at the height of the Lazulian golden age. At this point in history, Lazuli dominated the (+,-) region holding thousands of square meters of territory.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 20</a><div class="page-content">"The Republic needed places to mine, so NateMagic, a Lazulian Council member, ventured far out onto the fringes of the world to find untouched Vanilla chunks. Nate found the frozen little island and built a portal, started a farm, and opened up a mine. The"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 20</a><div class="page-content">"mines underneath the Citadel Isles go on for an eternity. There\u0027s still massive amounts of resources down there. If one ventures down into them, they can find remnants of old mining camps and roads. One particularly well preserved camp was one belonging "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">to MiniBen, who set up camp near bedrock and started a small melon farm. 

The Lazuli mining camp never saw many people there, so it fell out of use in the days of Lazuli's downfall.

Several months later, NateMagic returned to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">the island with several others to build a stronghold. This was when Nate came up with the name "The Citadel" which has stuck with the place ever since. Nate brought his entire wealth of resources to the barren land and began construction.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">"The Citadel Tower was about halfway completed when Nate was forced to leave. He left the remaining task to SomethingSaucy, another former Lazulian. Saucy had lost everything in the Pumpkin Jack-Lazuli war, when he was head of the Lazulian "</div></div>

When Nate left, Saucy picked up where he left off. He finished</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">the main tower and began other projects and exploring the nearby islands. 

Soon after Nate left, Ttocs_is_Awe joined Saucy's quest to complete the Citadel, which is where things are currently.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 20</a><div class="page-content">II. Eastern Island

The Eastern Island is the smallest of the islands. The name of the island is "Edgeland" as that is what is was called by early Lazulian explorers. 

In the days of the Lazuli mining outpost,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 20</a><div class="page-content">a Brother from the Night's Watch of Castle Black stumbled upon te island. His name was "blargblarg" and he dubbed the land be called Edgeland as it is known today. 

Blargblarg left only a sign and some supplies in a chest before heading off, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">island lay untouched until Ttocs rediscovered it.

The main island already had cows inhabiting it, but the sheep were on Edgeland. Ttocs built a land bridge to bring the sheep over. A little while after that, the cattle and sheep were relocated back to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Edgeland, where the Citadel's farmhouse and silo are currently. 

There are mines underneath Edgeland, so far a gold ore vein has been found. Further expeditions are being planned.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">III. Western Island

The Western Island is the least developed of the three, yet it is the largest. Remains of a settlement have been found on the island, but the only record of the place is a sign labeling it "City 17."

Other than the sign,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 20</a><div class="page-content">there is signs of mining and even an uncovered dungeon, with a spawner covered in torches. The nether portal that was built there sits on top of a small obsidian bridge. The portal itself links to the Citadel portal on the netherside.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 20</a><div class="page-content">My theory on who settled there and built "City 17" is that it was also early Lazulian explorers who came to mine here. 

Further diggings are underway to try and uncover new clues about the mysteriously abandoned settlement.</div></div>
