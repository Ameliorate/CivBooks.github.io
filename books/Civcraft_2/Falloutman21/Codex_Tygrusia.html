-Falloutman21
 In the beginning, there were but mountains, dotting the great skies of civcraft, a sacred land of Chanada, pure, unsullied.

Chanada lives for years, states rising and falling as they saw fit, until one fateful day.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 12</a><div class="page-content">The coming of /k/ompound

 A religious war had broken Chanada apart, as various groups sought to spread their beliefs. It was in the aftermath of this war, that the first structure of Tygrus would unwittingly be built, the /k/ube mission.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">This small outpost, constructed by Falkenzz, worshipper of the /k/ompounds god, the murdercube, a false idol if any ever was. 

Three structures, a church, two sheds, and a board proclaiming their authority, as well as a small farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 12</a><div class="page-content">It would not last, however. The structure was abandoned soon, reclaimed by the next winter.

Soon after, the site would be shaken. The eternal inhabitants, the deep dwelling dwarves sought the light of the sun.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 12</a><div class="page-content">Tygrus Ascending -

The earth shook, as overnight, the snow cleared from the misty peaks, and the area was blessed with a name, 'Tygrus'. 

The dwarves were few in number, but quick to start work on their grand city.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">BobNamg and Falloutman21 would be the first two leaders of the project, eager to see their city rise to the highest powers of the land. 

A small township soon became a budding fortress, more and more people came from lands around to visit and homestead,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"the hills, once barren and lifeless, were now razed, and studded with a mighty walled city atop it, for many months, the people of the town worked diligently, and a constitution was struck, it seemed nothing could stop them now."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 12</a><div class="page-content">- The Amber Age

Then came the Amber age. Time seemed to stop for the city, for months, the people of it seemed but a memory, gone, dissapeared into the past. Even their elected leaders seemed to have vanished.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 12</a><div class="page-content">- The month of unbending will

The Amber could not hold Tygrus for long. It was hardy, and its people strong.

Soon, once more a soul appeared within her walls. Bob, the father of the city stood alone.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 12</a><div class="page-content">He looked around his mighty projects, the memories flooding once more into his mind.

He felt sorrow for the fallen town, so struck by the Amber age, but he resolved that it should not last.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 12</a><div class="page-content">"He sent his calls out, messengers carrying the word to lands far and wide. The city would once again see life, once again work began. The city grew, at a rate not seen since its first inception. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">- The mists of tomorrow.

Now the city toils once more, hoping to acheive its destiny of greatness. But, just as before, only time may tell if it will break the bonds of destiny, and grow boundlessly, or fall once more to the ever present hold of Amber.</div></div>
