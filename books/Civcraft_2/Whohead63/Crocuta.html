   Unaware, the family trembled in the now cold room. The only sound was the that of their breath, and the ringing in their ears that accompanied the dead silence.
   A few minutes elapsed from the last explosion. They</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 42</a><div class="page-content">grew weary, holding their breath and then releasing it. Were they done? Or are they approaching?
   Beyond the window, a figure appeared. He stopped at the side of the canal, his back to the disquieted family. Male, cloaked, heavily armored.</div></div>

   Then, another earthshattering explosion. The house shook and the children screamed.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 42</a><div class="page-content">This is the story of Konvexen's death.

Several months ago--

It was the shrill, monotonous complaints itaqi said that woke Konvexen that morning. This was typical. Konvexen got out of their shared bed, groggy and annoyed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"Why haven't you moved out yet?" Itaqi would say. "You literally can't live here." He would shout. Konvexen was, frankly, getting tired of it.

"I'm going to get the paper." Konvexen belted.

"Don't come back."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Itaqi replied.

Konvexen stepped into his minecart and teleported out of his obsidian den. There, he waled out from the vast, abysmal emptiness that is the Defiance Towers and toward the gate. After openning it and looking around, protecting</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"himself from the wind with his robe, he came to realize that no newspaper is, or ever has been, delivered in Orion. He began to shut the gate when he saw, just one house over, a petite girl in a purple outfit talking to his neighbor, Silverwill_JDK. "</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 42</a><div class="page-content">In the shortness of the glance he managed to see that the door was quickly slammed in her face.

"How rude!" Konvexen thought, "He oughta make that right!"

He continued glancing only to notice she was coming his way. He was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 42</a><div class="page-content">briefly excited, then he regained his cool.

She approached Defiance.

"Hello, are you interestede in learning about the Goddess?" she said.

"The Goddess? What's that?" Konvexen</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 42</a><div class="page-content">feigned.

"Oh, she's awesome. Essentially, she created the universe and made men inferior. Want the book?"

"Sure!" Konvexen grabbed the book and pretended to read through. Some odd words caught his eye,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 42</a><div class="page-content">but nothing he thought too long about. He bagan considering the possibility of a relationship with this girl. Based almost entirely on the fact her minecraft skin was feminine.

"Cool book! How many did you make?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"A few dozen."

"So..." Konvexen started, without looking away from the book, "Do you have a church?"

"Yea..."

"How many did you make?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"Like a handful."

There was then an awkward silence. Konvexen was running out of ideas. "So... what's your name?"

"Z0ya"

"Z0ya? What's that mean?"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"I don't know. Do you want to join my church or not?"

"See, I'm Konvexen, and I got that by picking a bunch of random scrabble letters."

"Cool."

"Yeah..." Konvexen was confused. She wasn't</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 42</a><div class="page-content">interested in the origin of his name? He knew he had to try something drastic.

"You look -- Good." He bursted.

"Thanks, Konvexen" Z0ya replied, a part of her actually blushing.

"So... um..." Kon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 42</a><div class="page-content">sputtered, twirling the belt of his robe, "Do you like wanna go to the Dim Angler... later... like tonight?"

Silence.

"So we can talk about the Goddess." Konvexen finished.

Z0ya, trying not to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 42</a><div class="page-content">show flattery, said, "Um, sure. 7 o'clock?"

Konvexen was astounded. A date? With a person! Not just a person, someone who identifies as a girl! Would he finally get to pop his cyber cherry? 
"YES! 7 is fine with me! More than fine! See</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 42</a><div class="page-content">you there!"

He slammed the door. (In her face.) His face was totally red, butterflies fluttered away in his stomach.

A date.

-<>-<*>-<>-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 42</a><div class="page-content">It was now 7 o'clock at the Dim Angler. The place was as busy as ever. Konvexen walked in and saw Seldomshock and Itaqi talking. Interrupting, he decided to chat them up.

"Hi, guys! OMG, didn't expect to see you here!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"Kon, did you leave my house yet?"

"No. I have a date."

"Is that related?"

"Um.. no."

"Ok. Good job..."

"You're just jealous."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"Go away."

Konvexen was mad. He was tired of Itaqi's shit. He banged the piston-table. "Itaqi! You're such a dick! You're a dick like 90% of the time! You should be focusing on Actual Orion instead of drinking here! Fuck you!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Itaqi's potion fell and splattered all over Konvexen, staining his glittering armor.

"You asshole! My skin! Make it right!"

"What"

"You fucking covered me in pot, you dick!"</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"No I didn't."

"Make it right, Itaqi! Fix it! Fix it!

Obsidian Overlord noticed the commotion and decided the best thing to do would be to interject.

"Whoa, Kon, calm down. I've got some</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 42</a><div class="page-content">invisibility potion in the back if you need it."

"Really?" Konvexen asked, "How many did you make?"

Then, there was a ringing at the front door. Konvexen looked, it was her. He panicked and drank the rest of Itaqi's pot to calm his</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 42</a><div class="page-content">nerves and walked back to his seat.

And then she came up to him, and slowness effect couldn't stop his heart from racing. She walked up to him and said, "Hi"

Konvexen reciprocated. It was all very intimate. Kon</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 42</a><div class="page-content">covered his stain with his hand. Z0ya covered it with her hand too.

Kon tried to explain, "I'm sorry. Itaqi, he yelled at me and he-"

Z0ya leaned in and whispered, "Who gives a shit?"

Z0ya then said, in a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 42</a><div class="page-content">hushed, nearly sexy tone, "I brought something to show you." 

Maybe it was the drinks, but Konvexen was suddenly aroused.

"What?" was all he could say.

She then took out</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 42</a><div class="page-content">from under her dress a long, thin, plastic stick.

"It's for sounding." she said.

Kon, a little intrigued, asked, "What's sounding?"

Z0ya replied.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 42</a><div class="page-content">"Ok, so I was thinking that you take this dildo here and gently push it up the length of your uretha. That\u0027s what sounding is. And while you do that maybe I could put a strap-on on and fuck you in the ass while shouting \u0027Attack on Titan\u0027 references."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 42</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span><span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span><span class="fmt4"><span class="fmtcode">§4</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>WHA!!<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>--" Kon erupted before spitting out his drink on the bar. "<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>Whaaaa!?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>" Z0ya reached out and rubbed his arm. "§§<span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span><span class="fmtn"><span class="fmtcode">§n</span>§§<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmto"><span class="fmtcode">§o</span>Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span><span class="fmtl"><span class="fmtcode">§l</span>§ <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>stay away from me!" He fell back on the ground and vomited.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 42</a><div class="page-content">Everyone in the bar turned ang gave a quick scream. "Oh my god. Oh god." Kon continued to mutter. Z0ya bent down to try and help him up, which was the right thing to do, and on the way down asked "Are you into scat?" and he kicked her in the face. Kon ran</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 42</a><div class="page-content">out of the bar on all fours, tripping and falling twice more. Itaqi opened the door for him and he ran right out into the River Freedom. He was caught in the current and swept out to sea, never to be heard from again.
