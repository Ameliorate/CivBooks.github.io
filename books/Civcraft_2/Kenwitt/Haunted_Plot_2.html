<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The thing had managed to drag its upper torso from out of the ground by the time I arrived. I suspect that the rain had softened the ground a bit and eased its endeavor. The creature’s head was humanoid, but somewhat decayed and green.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It growled (more of a gurgle) as it pulled its lower half upward. 
I stood there paralyzed, such a thing couldn’t be real, but here it was before my eyes. I didn’t bother rubbing them to clear any falsity of vision away… my hands were full.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Instead I hid and lowered my torch and watched from afar as the thing wandered. It moved slowly, shuffling and dragging one of its legs, which appeared broken. It was clearly human-like, and had all of our anatomy with little variation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content"> It began to shuffle away from the plot and down the street towards the library. I followed it, torch lowered. I had hoped it wouldn’t notice me as it made its way around buildings and through alleys.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I was wrong; I turned the corner around the storage shed and it lunged toward me. I made the mistake of assuming it unintelligent... 
It attacked my torch hand first.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I dropped the torch and it went out before it touched the ground. Then the creature attempted to bite me. My reaction was slow, but I managed to resist and cut off his arm with my blade.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It cringed, but continued its assault. I used its hesitation to my advantage, and slashed across its torso. It gave a sickened crunch as the sword sliced through it like butter.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The creature fell to the ground, but its upper half crawled toward me on with its arms! I panicked and slashed into its head with the sword, sundering its skull in two. The assault ended when its brain was dashed on the pavement.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I rushed home without turning around and locked myself in...
My arm was in incredible pain the following day, and turned ever so green. I covered it up and treated it myself without the doctor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I feared that I may have contracted the same condition that plagues Happyfce, and no longer do I question what may have attacked him. It was undoubtedly the creature I slew the night before.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I checked on Happyfce to see if his condition improved. The doctor was already outside of his lab but refused me entrance claiming Happy had gone mad and green, attacking anything living near. The doctor said he had to restrain the poor fellow.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">My concern for Happy was short lived when I remembered my own wound. I didn’t trust the doctor to keep my wounds a secret once we saw what happened to Happy. I went home and searched the library for any clues to find a remedy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Nothing was found in the medical records or research, but to my surprise the old books regarding ancient druidism and magick had a clue. The old tomes spoke about a strange curse that caused sane men to become “green as leaves, and ravenous for flesh.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I continued my search regarding this disease, which the ancients called “Bhal’ool” when translated, means ‘Satan’s Curse’.
The tomes spoke of a cure, a simple mixture of local herbs and water</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">which could turn even the fully fledged “Bhal” into a normal man again. It took time for me to find the modern names of the herbs, but they did grow nearby once identified.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I was lucky that the fashion here allows me to wear gloves and long-sleeves even during summer. I did not want anyone questioning my slowly transforming blue-green arm as I searched the countryside for grasses.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">More of my arm turned green and it began spreading to my chest. I hoped that the old remedy would help. It took two days to find everything I needed, and the doctor told me that happyfce wasn’t recovering.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I implored him to give him a few more days, and allow me to see him. He finally consented. My visit was going to be brief. I prepared the remedy ahead of time; mixing the herbs with water.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The result was a pasty blue-green substance, similar to my arm. I quickly dabbed some on my wounds then headed over to the lab. Happy was there, his entire body was green and he looked just like the creature I had slain a few nights ago.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">I placed the substance on a sponge on the end of a stick and slowly dabbed at his wounds until my arms were too tired to lift the rod any longer. Happy gurgled and lurched toward me the entire time, a monster.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It saddened me to see my friend in such a state.
This continued for the next few hours. I checked on my wounds during that time. The green had begun to subside and my arm was slowly returning to normal.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">There was however, no change in Happy.
I still had some paste left, so I thought perhaps it should be ingested. I grabbed Happy’s head and held him down, shoving the bottle opening into his mouth and pouring the remaining pastes down his throat.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">He fought and struggled, but the substance went down. He relaxed soon after, and given a few minutes began to revert back to Human. I summoned the doctor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 28</a><div class="page-content">He was amazed at Happy’s recovery and inquired at what I had done. I disclosed everything that had happened since I first saw the creature’s hand, with the exception of my injury.
Afterwards I went home and documented the event.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The suspicion of Plot 14 never changed, even after the strange noises have ended, and missing farm animals no longer occur. The place is gloomy. But nonetheless it is harmless, and I feel that the danger that was once there is long gone...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 28</a><div class="page-content">For now my wounds have completely healed, and Happy is once again fully human. I still see little of Erik.  I only hope that his life has turned out to be much better.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Perhaps someday he will return home and remain at ease. I do hope to see my old friend again.
