<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The sky was bleak, grey and oppressive, the streets barren and cold in the cloud-filtered light. The announcement from general Thoths of the Augustan Armed Forces was coming through all the radios of Mt. Augusta and beyond, his voice</span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">grainy and tense. Families huddled around their living rooms or kitchens, listening intently, fathers clutching their wives and children.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Doors began to open, and out came citizens, stumbling onto the cold grey streets, crying, yelling, lamenting ProgrammerDan.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A few hundred meters East, the citizens of New Detroit, capital of the Gensokyojin Federation, were just now beginning to wake.
