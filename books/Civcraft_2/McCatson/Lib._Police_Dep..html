<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”
“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 23</a><div class="page-content">They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”
“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down …</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 23</a><div class="page-content">provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”
He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 23</a><div class="page-content">Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 23</a><div class="page-content">It didn’t seem like they did.
“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. 
Cash is fine, but I'd prefer being paid in gold bullion or</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 23</a><div class="page-content">autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.
Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 23</a><div class="page-content">but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.
I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 23</a><div class="page-content">He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 23</a><div class="page-content">The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 23</a><div class="page-content">I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 23</a><div class="page-content">“No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 23</a><div class="page-content">He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.</div></div>
