~~The Corum Years (Early 2013) ~~
After arriving at the True Neutral League base camp on the first day of 1.0, I decided to explore the map. On the test maps I had loved </div></div>

I finally found one far northeast of the TNL basecamp, and heard what sounded like settlers in the region. I arrived at the NPC village that would become Iria, where Lottosprayer and</div></div>

After seeing the world, I felt there was no location more beautiful than Iria's, so I decided to make that my home. While still attached to Fellowship, I</div></div>

Iria thrived, as did the other towns in the Corum Region. Regional trade began, and the  Corum Alliance was formed. A road network was completed, and there was talk of a rail network next. Irians</div></div>

After the Valkyria vault break, a Valkyrian made an ominous prediction: Corum was about to fall, and there would only be one city left. I thought he was being pessimistic, but he was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 41</a><div class="page-content">right.

And that city was Iria.

~~The Post-Corum Years (Mid 2013) ~~~

Despite losing all our allies and trading partners, Iria soldiered on, and actually did quite well for a period. Iria's</div></div>

DiamondReaper built a hotel to house newfriends. IHOP007 built a sewer system, u5ggg built a bumper boat pool. Lottosprayer began building a gigantic "</div></div>

However, the fiun in Iria ended up coming to an end for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 41</a><div class="page-content">a number of reasons.

Lottosprayer quit without notice or explanation. This plunged the town into chaos as he was the sole admin of a few citadel groups, and was half way through building his cathedral. He left behind him a hulking unfinished</div></div>

It was so big nobody wanted to demolish it, we just hoped Lotto would one day reappear to finish it. It was just a depressing influence that overshadowed the town and any progress we tried to make. It "</div></div>

In the aftermath of Lotto's disappearance a council of Horizon, 3earGryllis, 5365616e, Sloths_Rock and myself were eventually formed to lead Iria. The council proved to be ineffective.</div></div>

While I still feel their actions were out of line, I do think we should have been more pragmatic with their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 41</a><div class="page-content">sentences. Perhaps we targeted the anger from all the criminals we didn't get toward Zash/Geo. Irians ending up inside the Irian vault was an "end of innocence" for the once carefree town.

Iria slipped into further isolation as Bryn and Fellowship</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 41</a><div class="page-content">went inactive. We were now more alone, and even more at the mercy of raiders.

Iria was raided and then occupied by INF raiders for a number of days. Nobody came to help us, other than a bounty hunter named DosEquisMan. We co-ordinated</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 41</a><div class="page-content">days after living in Aurura I logged on to find someone rushing past my house on fire. The Bloodcrew occupation of Aurora had begun. I had jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.

I decided to return to Iria, and lived as a</div></div>

Not much happened in this time. I saw the occasional traveler, and the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 41</a><div class="page-content">occasional Irian checking in.

Skywatch was founded South of Iria, and then</div></div>

~~The Revival Years (Early 2014) ~~

In January 2014 I logged on to see someone had been in</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 41</a><div class="page-content">the cave I had been living, and had left a friendly sign. Like a spring flower, Iria was coming back to life. I feel there were three crucual things that led to Iria's revival:

-Zash and an explorer, Krist, starting the "Iria Restoration Committee."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 41</a><div class="page-content">While others ended up doing most of the actual resoration, they encouraged others to be more active  and got the ball rolling again.

<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 41</a><div class="page-content">on a much smaller plot of land.

-With Fellowship and Bryn revived, and Saraliana founded north of us, and rail built right under town, Iria was no longer isolated, and for the first time in many months had potential allies and trade</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 41</a><div class="page-content">partners within reasonable distance.

A large amount of old Iria was demolisher to allow for new developments and a new town plan. We started to work on new projects, but there were some minor conflicts in this period.</div></div>

After their assault on River\u0027s End failed disastrously, Recharge came through Iria to inspect Papa\u0027s base, but left Iria alone. But I remember the panic in Iria "</div></div>
