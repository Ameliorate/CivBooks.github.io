2Pacalypse Now (1991)
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 43</a><div class="page-content">There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 43</a><div class="page-content">I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 43</a><div class="page-content">They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 43</a><div class="page-content">He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community

Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me ?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 43</a><div class="page-content">I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back

They got me trapped</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Can't use tha phone 
Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in

I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 43</a><div class="page-content">He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away

Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin "Damn homies is dissin you"
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 43</a><div class="page-content">I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain

Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 43</a><div class="page-content">Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
