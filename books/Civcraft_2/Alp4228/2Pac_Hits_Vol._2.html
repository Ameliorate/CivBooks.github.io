Me Against The World
1995

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
with the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 46</a><div class="page-content">And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 46</a><div class="page-content">for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Lady... 
Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't cha know we love ya?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 46</a><div class="page-content">I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 46</a><div class="page-content">I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 46</a><div class="page-content">And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 46</a><div class="page-content">And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 46</a><div class="page-content">Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 46</a><div class="page-content">To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 46</a><div class="page-content">There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 46</a><div class="page-content">If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated</div></div>
