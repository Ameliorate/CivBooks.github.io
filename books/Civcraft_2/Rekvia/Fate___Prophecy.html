<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Slowly we drifted, deeper through the void. Our very world was changing before our eyes, and the mortal men are to blame.

Sitting on the edge of the small island, I recounted what happened today, but looking back at it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content">we should've seen this coming sooner. News had spread that men were harvesting the core of our People and combining them with the power of a blazing demon to guide them to the portal between worlds. 

They appeared on a platform</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content">made from the same material the obelisks were forged out of as dark as the void itself. The Dragon, our leader and guardian, was our only means of defending our homeland. They fired arrows as the Dragon pushed them over the edge into the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content">abyss, but they evaded and aimed for the obelisks that khealed and empowered our Dragon. One by one, the obelisks exploded as the energy inside was released at the cracking of the crystals on top. 

Unknowingly to our</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content">attackers, those very crystals are what linked the islands of the End together.  Our islands became unstable and drifted out into the emptiness. I watched as the main island infront us grew smaller as my island drifted away. 

The Dragon was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content">losing strength quickly, I could see it in how he flew ever so slowly and low. Finally, an arrow struck him and he froze where he flew. He let out a roar of pain as the energy inside him started to rip him apart from the inside out. Streaks of light</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">escaped through cracks forming between his scales and eating away at his wings as he rose up higher into the air. That was when he dropped the infertile egg, their prize for slaying our guardian. It was at that moment our Dragon opened up a portal</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content">below his place of incoming death in an effort to destroy the mainland, but it was too small and weak to eat away at the land. Then, as I looked away from my distant home, I saw where our islands were floating towards. The destruction of the crystals and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">death of the Dragon caused a rip in the void, leading to what looks like a world filled with fire, swine people, and death. 

The islands were slowly making their way to this rip in dimmensions, but it would take years for each island to enter.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content">By the time my island makes it, I could be the only one left to tell the story of what happened this terrible day. Most people were shaken off the islands as they drifted away, others jumped to avoid what lies ahead. 

How could this happen?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content">One day, these islands will crash into the world they are headed to and the stone they rest on will sink, leaving behind the remains of the towers on top. Once that day comes, I will settle down and rebuild what I can of what we once were and name it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content">Requiem, a repose for the souls of those lost this day. 

I will bring a dreadful plague to these men. Their cities will be contaminated, livestock killed, and crops rendered too dangerous to use.

CivDisease is coming.</div></div>
