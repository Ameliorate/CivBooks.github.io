It has cleared the land, dried the marshes, pierced the forests, made roads; it has been building, inventing, observing, reasoning; it has created a complex machinery, wrested her secrets from Nature, and finally it has made a servant of steam.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 48</a><div class="page-content"> And the result is, that now the child of the civilized man finds ready, at its birth, to his hand an immense capital accumulated by those who have gone before <span class="fmt0">him.And<span class="fmt0"> this capital enables him to acquire, merely by his own labour, combined with the labour</div></div>

And where man wishes to double his produce, to treble it, to multiply it a hundred-fold, he makes the soil, gives to each plant the requisite care, and thus obtains enormous returns. While the hunter of old had to scour</div></div>

It is</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the forests, to drain the marshes, and to open up highways by land and water. Every  rood of soil we cultivate in Europe has been watered</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 48</a><div class="page-content">by the sweat of several races of men.

But men of genius are themselves the children of industry as well as of science. Not until thousands of steam-engines had been working for years before all eyes, constantly transforming heat into dynamic force, and this force</div></div>
