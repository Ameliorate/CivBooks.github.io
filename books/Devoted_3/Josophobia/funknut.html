What is known to us is only the legend that remains. The legend of a mineman like no other that shall be told for ages to come.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 11</a><div class="page-content">His legend begins in a small island at the edge of the world. A man whose name is as ancient as the world itself had lived in the depths of that island. The man has seen our young hero wandering through the realm, seeing great potential within him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The man recruited our hero under his cause, and thus the new funknut was born.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The man has given funknut tools and clothing of the highest quality, which were dug from the core of the earth, and with them funknut has worked tirelessly day and night.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 11</a><div class="page-content">However, not all things were bright for our hero, because with friends come enemies. Some have disliked funknut, for various reasons, but they pale in comparison to the forces he was to clash with.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 11</a><div class="page-content">Into the community that lived on the edge of the world, ventured a foul, horrid being that spread hatred in its path. the being has infiltrated and lived between funknut's fellow recruits but funknut could stand his presence no more.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 11</a><div class="page-content">funknut has fought to banish the abhorrent being at their midst, yet he did not succeed in his fight.

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 11</a><div class="page-content">He lives on a different day, at a different land, none knowing of the path he took.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">As for the foul being, it was banished from the land many ages after the vanishing of funknut.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 11</a><div class="page-content">The legend of the man known as funknut stays with us to this day to teach us of how we should be.
