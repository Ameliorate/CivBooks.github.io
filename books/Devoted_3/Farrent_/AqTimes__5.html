<span class="fmt0">Volterra and Ruin have been in a long standing strife ever since the initial <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">World Police<span class="fmt0"> split. Recently, though, Ruin and Volterra signed a treaty which brought peace upon the two nations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 25</a><div class="page-content">However, on the date of May 3rd, conflict arose once again between the two nations.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 25</a><div class="page-content">This situation first began escalating when Volterran senators were found taking items from a vault located in Wyvernhurst. According to Volterra, these items were taken under the assumption that Wyvernhurst was an inactive nation,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 25</a><div class="page-content">and their leader, Sl33pinggiant, would not mind, due to being related to a Volterran senator. However, a Wyvernhurstan citizen by the name of, “happy_ninja” was still active, and demanded reparations from Volterra.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 25</a><div class="page-content">In an interview with S4NTA, S4NTA claims Volterra offered to pay reparations back. Shortly after, though, happy_ninja created a post on <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmto">/r/Devoted<span class="fmt0"> condemning Volterra. According to S4NTA, these actions sparked the beginning of the second war.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Ruin then attacked Volterra, under grounds of lack of completion of their terms on the treaty, and general acts of aggression. These grounds, provided by Ruin, include pearling people with little justification, stealing the Cantina claim,</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 25</a><div class="page-content">According to S4NTA, meetings were held where Ruin did not express any issues with their actions. However, Dollaz claims that Volterra ignored Ruin’s numerous warnings to complete the actions within the treaty, despite having meetings.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Dollaz has stated his reasoning for reigniting the war; he believes that, after this length of time without Volterra following the terms of the treaty, Volterra does not plan on following through.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 25</a><div class="page-content">However, S4NTA has voiced concerns over Ruin’s reasoning. According to S4NTA, Ruin had a supposed lack of interest in the Wyvernhurst incident in diplomatic meetings, S4NTA has stated,<span class="fmt0"></span>

<span class="fmt0">Tuesday, May 2, a gruesome war between Aquilans occurred. However, this was no war of ill will. This was a mock war, held as a friendly game between Aquilans.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">Sweetgiggles43, Patsrul, IcyPigChicken, Sheluvedit, CaesariLegio<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">and Gjum participated in this Farley war. This was held in the City of Acre, located in Obsidia.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Many rounds were had, such as games with alternating weaponry,<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">1 versus all, and free-for-alls.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">According to Aquilan citizen sgtshannon, IcyPigChicken, Sheluvedit, and Patsrul were triumphant in the majority of the games.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Once again, these were games with no ill intention and it is hoped that we will see more events such as these in the future.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">With the Aquilan rail station nearing completion after months of hard work, Aquilan citizen MathInTheBath has constructed a new entryway to the rail station.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Though not yet operational, when arriving in Aquila, you will be pumped through the heart of Aquila’s eagle, and arrive in the station. As it currently is, you arrive in the station via a two-way rail. However, this new entryway will funnel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 25</a><div class="page-content">arrivals into a single line, which follows a bridge inside the station, dropping passengers off in the station, where they can then choose their destination. MathInTheBath believes this entryway is an excellent thematic approach to the rail line.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 25</a><div class="page-content">Look forward to seeing this new entryway when arriving in Aquila soon.</div></div>
