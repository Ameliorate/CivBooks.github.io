<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> At the fact he said that the plots were too small, I jumped for joy, literrally, because I hated my small house. Everyone looked at me weirdly then... He continued,<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> I was disapointed that I could'nt do anything interesting at the time, but oh well. Later, we got a newfriend</div></div>
