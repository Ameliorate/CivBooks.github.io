<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>+++++++++++++++++++This diary is based upon my experiences upon the exploration of the underwater city that was recently found near the shores of Nova Blyat.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A city I decided to name 'Perdido'. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The city was first found during the exploration of the many ruins that can be found in Nova Blyat, it seems evident that this island has always held a large amount of citizens in it, be it today's monsters and fiends, or the ancient people</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">that used to inhabit these destroyed, decrepit ruins.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The ruins' coordinates wont be disclosed in this journal, lest unwary travelers may find themselves in trouble when approaching it. But a little of patience and exploring will prove to</div></div>

A city with a skyline of light, yet only to be condemned to the festering darkness of the depths.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Us Templars aren't supposed to be afraid of anything, nothing can corrupt our mindset</div></div>

Everytime I took a heavy, soaking wet step across the wrecked streets, I could feel the sins of a past</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">civilization gnawing at the back of my head. Just what kind of abominations were commited here, to be condemned to obliteration off the face of the earth, to be forgotten, to be forever crushed between mud and gravel.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">With time, it became obvious that this city used to be much larger than what it might appear, the ruins that can now be visited are what I esteem only 1/16th of what the city used to be, maybe even less. This can be proven by the same kinds of stones</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This city seemed to pay cult to an elder entity, I took every soaked book and piece of papyrus I could scrape off and took it to my manor, which allowed me to keep myself to comfortable study for a couple of</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Obscene, explicit tales of unspeakable powers, at the price of lives, of sanctity - At the price of what I assume was what they had of humanity.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Studying the papyrus and books led to the conclusion</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">that in it's final days, the city was destroyed by righteous knights of the templar order. It's citizens slayed, explicit descriptions of the putrid smell of their blood flooding the streets, which was so thick it could climb up the ankles of your armour.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">This city was, and is. A symbol of pagan idiocy, and I regret having found it. Like the icon of sin that stands ever so proudly in Nova Blyat, it is an icon to humanity's worst features. But it still is a symbol of culture of this island, rest assured.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Even if I don't like it, any pagan ruins I am to find in this island wont be destroyed, or even sanctified. Let this be a permanent reminder of the mistakes we must never repeat.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A single, stone limb, an alien figure standing from below the depths, up towards the sky. Like an arcane hand reaching from hell itself, thrilled to having been found.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>That city is a festering abomination.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
