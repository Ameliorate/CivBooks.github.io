<span class="fmt0">"You dont have access, one sec..."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">She could only handle about half an hour of struggling to dig, with me as a reminder to her slowness. It didnt help that I was pulling up ores faster than she could open doors. So she logged out. At this</div></div>

We felt too threatened by the consistent raids by B0W and other griefers while we were living in Alpoko. I liked the folks over there, but Havana's lax leadership and absence made the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">   So we moved to Mt. Augusta. Sir_Grettir was kind enough to escort us, accompanied by Mirakels. They gave us a space of undeveloped land in the countryside, and we set to work right away. We soon had a small wheat and carrot</div></div>

After a week or so, I familiarized myself with my neighbors. Joined the discord. I found a fellow farmer across the border that had cows, sheep, and pigs. I was able to buy a couple pigs off em,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">   Now, the thing about playing Devoted- playing multiplayer- <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">is that no matter what you build, it can be destroyed.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   Sammy and I were out harvesting crops. My Radar</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">   Now, when youre a pvp'r, your reflexes and sense are tuned to acute detections and focus on small, fast messages spamming from all sides. You are ready to react on a moments notice. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">I am not a pvp'r.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And Sammy certainly isnt.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   So by the time I actually noticed the mounted rider in full diamond gear, Sammy was already burnt to crisp, her seeds and wheat scattered round the ground where she stood. OmSaiRam greeted us with 2 words:</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">  I was already running.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">  My only chance was to dip into the mine, and get to the bunker we just made... but it isnt reinforced yet! theres no gurantee of safety....<span class="fmt0"></span></span>

Luckily, the knockback from his attack propelled me toward the waterdrop we have to our mine. I scrambled to break the secret entrance, replace the blocks, and sprint to the bunker. I turned off the lights, squeezed the</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">    Someone must have heard my prayers, because he was still triggering the snitches up at the treehouse. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">   "From: SammyField214: AHH! He killed me! what do I do?!"</div></div>

I'm not a pvp'r, I'm not a political power player, Im not an expert or griefer or artist or architect, I dont do anything beyond the average. And now I was being punished for my weakness.
