<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Beneshire was founded by Irian citizen Magmus on the nineteenth of July 2015, having been named by the Citadel group "MTA_Nether". At first, Beneshire lacked land, but Rekvia, queen of the nearby nation of Requiem</div></div>

Progress was slow, with Magmus finishing the first building in town on the second of August, but farms and a rail to the bordering Abyssi Empire were created soon after.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Beneshire stands as a prime example of why newfriend towns are discouraged by experienced players. The city was doomed from the beginning, with no beginning population invested in the town, the town made no progress.</div></div>
