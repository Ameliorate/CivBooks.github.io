<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Some basic ideas or propagandic principles which subversive propaganda can use rather than open propaganda are to tell people exactly what they want to hear, rationalize for them the line of  least resistance.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>An important thing to remember:</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As a general rule, even in war time, all persons including the redditors  and troops and our sympathizers in occupied nations follow the line of at least resistance and avoid exposing themselves to danger or pain.</div></div>

Where we want to inspire resistance among accupied peoples we should create plausible, emotional, melodramatic martyrs and martyr stories.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 26</a><div class="page-content">These should of course be heroic martyrs who died fighting. Similarly, we should avoid doing the enemy a favor by creating any martyrs for his use.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It is obvious that a conquered people will never love their foreign rulers and that those who actually do the policing and administrating will be the most easily hated.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
