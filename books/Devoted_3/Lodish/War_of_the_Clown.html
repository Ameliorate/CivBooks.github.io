<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 15</a><div class="page-content">One time two clowns set themselves to arguing. The people would stop, amused, to watch them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  -What's that? they asked.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  -Why, it's only two clowns arguing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   Who could take them seriously? Ridiculous, the two comedians reparteed.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">The arguments were common nonsense, the theme was a ninnery. And an entire day passed.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   The following morning, the two remained, obnoxious and outdoing each other. It seemed as though, between them, even yucca soured. In the street, meanwhile,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">those presentwere exhilarated with the masquerade. The buffoons began worsening their insults with fine-edged and fine-tuned barbs. Believing it to be a show, the passerby left coins along the roadside.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>    On the third day, however, the clowns arrived at</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">acts of force. Their blows became a disarray, their counterkicks zinged more across air than across bodies. The children rollicked, imitating each jester's blows. And they laughed at the two fools, their bodies tripping upon their own selves. And the boys</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">wanted to repay the delightful goodness of the clowns.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  -Dad, give me some coins to leave on the sidewalk.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  On the fourth day, the jabs and blows grew worse. Beneath their makeup, the faces of the clowns began to bleed. Some kids became scared.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 15</a><div class="page-content">Was that true blood?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  -It's not serious, don't fret, their parents soothed them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  In failures of trajectory, some were struck by the directionless wallops. But it was light fare, only serving to add to the laughs. More and more people joined the gallery</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">  -What's going on?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   Nothing. A friendly unsettling of accounts. It's not worth seperating them. They'll tire out, it's noting more than a bit of clowning around.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   On the fifth day, however, one of the clowns armed himself with a stick. Advancing on</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">his adversary, he discharged a blow that tore off his wig. The other, furious, equipped himself with a symmetrical beating bat and responded with the same dismeasure. The wooden rods whistled through the air in somersaults and deliriums.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">One of the spectators, unexpectantly, was struck. The man fell, deadspread.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   A certain confusion arose, the souls divided. Little by little, two battlefields began to form. Various groups traded drubbings. Still more were felled.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>   It entered a second</div></div>

And the thing embroiled the entire plaza. And the neighbors found it funny. Some went to the plaza to verify the reports. They returned with</div></div>

The neighborhood continued to divide itself, in opposing opinions. Conflicts began in some neighborhoods.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>  On the twentieth day, shots began to be heard. No one knew exactly where they came from. Could</div></div>

Full of terror, the inhabitants armed themselves. The tiniest movement seemed suspect. The shots spread. Dead bodies began to accumulate in the streets. Terror reigned over the whole city. Soon, massacres began.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">   At the beginning of the month, all the city's inhabitants had died. All except the two clowns. That morning, the comics sat, each one in his  corner, and ridded themselves of their ridiculous dress. They looked at each other, worn out. Later, they rose</div></div>

Arm in arm, they gathered the coins from the roadsides. Together they crossed the city destroyed, careful not to tread on the cadavers. And they went in seach of another city.</div></div>
