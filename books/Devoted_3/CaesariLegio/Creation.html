<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Gods? Forces? People? It does not matter what they were called, they were the three. They were all that was, all that would be.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Eldest was Mesh'la, wise, cautious, beautiful.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Next was Gotenir, creative, joyful, always-improving.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And youngest was Demagolka, eager, brave, strong.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Three existed for times eternal, enjoying the limits of such existance. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One day, Mesh'la invited her brothers around, to view a thing she had created, a magnificent thing.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>She had created a world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 28</a><div class="page-content">It was a land of raw beauty, of thing unimagineable. It was exotic and familiar at the same time. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The two were astounded by their sibling's creation, showering her in praise as they all partook in the wonders of this world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 28</a><div class="page-content">But it seemed that Mesh'la had even further suprises for them.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>For within the world she had created life, beasts of wonder to compliment the lands which they prowled. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But most of all, were the End'ra.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The End'ra were a peoples, created by Mesh'la. They were long, slender creatures of vast inteligence, capable of great magics.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Three spent eons exploring this new world, interacting with the End'ra. When one day Gotenir came with a suprise.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Gotenir had learned from the world created by his sister, he wanted to show both of his siblings what he could do. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He invited both of them to view his world, a world vastly larger than the other. A creation so vast that it is still largely unexplored.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 28</a><div class="page-content">We know it today as, The Overworld. Gotenir had crafted it all, the mountains, the lakes, the deserts.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>And he too, filled it with life. From the simple cow to the villiager, all were his creations.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But that was nothing.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 28</a><div class="page-content">For in this world he had also created the Player, a race of his own. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They were like the End'ra, but they lacked in magic and longevity of life. Instead they possessed the power of improvement. Able to adapt to anything.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The Three rejoyed, happy for Gotenir's achivement and they spent much time exploring the two worlds they had to rule over. The End'ra created structures of wonder upon their world. The Players too made great things, pyramids, mines reaching far below.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 28</a><div class="page-content">They made portals between their worlds, and the two races lived in harmony.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 28</a><div class="page-content">All the while, Demagolka was laboring on his own world. His siblings were so magestic that he wished to awe them, to show them something just as wondorus as their own creations. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He wished to make them happy, but over time his limits were tested.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Unlike his siblings, Demagolka was not a creator. He copied from his siblings, created things half-way, but was never able to fully form a world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He tried again and again, building over the worlds he discarded.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">The end result was the Nether, a graveyard of broken worlds unhospitable to any good.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was a sad place, an evil place. Where lava flowed as water and rock blocked out the skies.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It was here Demagolka toiled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">He next attempted to create life, to create a great race like the Players and the End'ra. But again these were failures.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He only resulted in abominations, in corruptions of peacful creatures from the other worlds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">In this time, Demagolka has isolated himself from his siblings. His time alone, with only his failures, had driven him mad.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Why should the others be so happy? How come they were beautiful and wonderful creations?<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 28</a><div class="page-content">He stewed in his depression, continueing to churn out abominations.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then he crafted an idea, a plot.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He forced his creations to build, to create weapons and warriors, to prepare.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 28</a><div class="page-content">If he could not have a world of beauty, no-one could.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He would bring all of existance into his own, dark reality, making the creations of his siblings as ruined and hell-like as his own.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Portals of black stone appeared all over the other worlds, and out from them poured the hordes of Demagolka's monsters.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They destroyed all the wonderous creations in their path. Tainting the lands of the other two.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Gotenir tried to fight his brother, but he was too strong. His world was ravaged by the bands of demons and monsters, the dead among the players being risen as undead, to fight mindlessly for Demagolka's cause.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Demagolka then turned his evil gaze to his sister, destorying her world to it's core.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>He tore the sky apart, tore the ground to pieces, leaving only black in his wake.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then he corrupted the End'ra, turning them too into his slaves.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 28</a><div class="page-content">Demagolka was within his greatest power, he transformed into a powerful dragon, and prepared to fully destory Gotenir's world next.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Only he was stopped.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>They could not kill him, so he became trapped within the ruins of Mesh'la's world.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>
