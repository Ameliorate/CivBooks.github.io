<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Eznys, seeing no help for it, threw his inventory down upon the ground, to at least avoid being pearled as well.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But at last with a sniff he shook his head and slouched off,</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Then Pride up in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said :<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Dollaz and Jumpysnake were disputing who was stronger.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Suddenly they saw a traveler coming down the road, and then Jumpysnake said:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"I see a way to decide our dispute."</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 28</a><div class="page-content">"Whichever of us can cause that traveler to take off his armor and give it to us shall be regarded as the stronger.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>So Jumpy retired behind a tree to watch, and Dollaz with a coolpvp smirk began to pot up and click upon the traveler.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 28</a><div class="page-content">As he clicked he was shouting “Give me your prot or die!”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>But the Faster he clicked more the traveler ran and needed to keep his armor for protection, till at last Dollaz had ran out of speed and gave up in despair.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 28</a><div class="page-content">So then Jumpysnake came out looking concerned for the traveler and kindly said, “Was that meanyface attacking you? I can beat him but have no armor, can I borrow yours?”<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A Chanadian and a Raider who has never been caught went to pillage a small town of newfriends together.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span><span class="fmtcode">§r</span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Channer thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating the WP came nearer and nearer-</div></div>
