<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 30</a><div class="page-content">This story begins in a sleepy little village not too far from here called Persepolis. A wonderful town build of stone and wood. A hearty town with a good thick broth. A wonderful town full of hope and imagination, where the bees go to sleep.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 30</a><div class="page-content">This little town found its way on the world stage and with it the community grew, and grew, and grew, and <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt5">it was pretty good and shit but then like some bad things happened.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt9">But you don't want to hear about that do you?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmtd">Yes - pg 5<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmtd">No - pg 4</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Good. The bad part of the story is the interesting part but I dunno, if you don't want to read about the bad things I don't blame you.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt3">Hear enough of that shit in real life, y'know?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmta">Bugger that.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">the end</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt6">Oh? So you wanted to read the bad part of the story?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Why?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt7">Do you find pleasure in other's misfortunes? That's not cool. Maybe you should go to a head doctor and get your self sorted out.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">No I mean it. Go get fixed then come back.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt3">But to continue on with the story....<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt1">I once was a superior individual. I had the money, I had the women and I had the power. All my desires in life were fulfilled. But then <span class="fmt5">the event happened.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmtc">...  ... ..... ..... !</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtc">The smell of dog piss dribbling down my leg, sparked a sudden inspiration.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmtc">What if I just did the thing I was supposed to do from the start?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2">A powerful question mind you, but not one I was going to answer.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2">Too much for me...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmtb">But there is this one thing I can tell you.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmtb">Its that there was nothing for this town to do, nothing for its people to excel in, nothing to become. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt9">So they did it. And exploded many things. From the government to the structures.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt9">Even the bins.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt8">  Have you ever witnessed that? The power of pure destruction, malice and freedom?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt7">A culmination of all that is rotten. Not written. Imagining this is beyond words. And I will tell you with all my vocabulary. Its just that.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5">Becoming boss was hard.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5">The task at hand was to write a simple guide. Nothing for those well versed in the written word. But for someone of my stature....<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmta">Broken, beaten and utterly incoherant. It was serving to be an awkward yet satisfying moment.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt4">Nothing that another few lines couldn't ease. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt4">This task was easier than imagined. But still a due diligence was needed.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt3">Overcoming an excessive use of aqua text, only in the minds of champions could one wish to achieve this.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt3">Still to best my foes it was best for all of us to strive, to continue for that fleeting shot at glory. Poets and prophets would speak of this day like any other, but those in tune with the essence of nature would understand where we were coming from.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 30</a><div class="page-content">It was a struggle all too real.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt4">But for and impressive person with a secret plan it was as easy as slicing bread.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt3">You will need:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt8">   1/2 cup soy<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt8">   3 tbspn sugar<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt8">   8 apricots<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt8">   and spice to taste</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 30</a><div class="page-content">Step 1:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt7">Mix it all in a bowl<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Step 2:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt7">Preheat over on 200 degrees (Whether that be celcius, foreignheit or angles, your choice)<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Step 3:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt8">Insert bowl<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt6">Step 4:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>

<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmta">Basically if you want to be successful, rich, full of friends and just generally be a lovable scoundrel then all you have to do is fund various terrorist activities.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2">Do NOT employ petty theives. They will ruin you and your buisiness. Not a joke.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt4">Stand up for the rights of man. Do not allow any sort of slavery or even indentured servitude. <span class="fmtc">A gaol sentence that does not end, cannot be permitted. Freedom for all, no matter what the cost.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmtc">Taxes shall not be paid until this happens.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt3">And that is the story of how I became boss. <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt3">Basically just don't do anything until I tell you to do it.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt1">I am the BOSS and I will tell you when you can do the things you should be doing shall be done.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt1">Don't mistake this for kindness. Its just fact.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt6">Me? I am just a simple man that had simple dreams. I did not ask to become the last and least respected member of the community. I just did what had to be done. I am a free agent, ready to be picked up at any time. No need for fear or regret.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 30</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt9">We did it.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt4">No truth to those words, it was just a mantra. But something we could respect and deal with in our own time. MEasures were taken for it not to become a reality.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmta">But our spines were ground to dust, and it was let to happen without us.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 30</a><div class="page-content">

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt5">  I expected more of you.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5">    Though I saw this happening before my eyes. Nothing to be sad about.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5">     I did love you at some point, but now? <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmtb">      Nothing.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt6">Thank you for all the memories. It was not wasted time, believe me. We have grown as human beings. We have found ourselves in this ruin. Don't cry.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
