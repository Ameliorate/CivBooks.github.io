<span class="fmt2">      By Greenkitten</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt2"> I once met a man who posted an otter.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Posted an otter?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Yes, a man who sent a live otter through the post.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Why would anyone do that?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> It was a mistake.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> A mistake, I would hope so!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"> Generally people only send letters and packages through the post. Never a living creature.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Yeah, that's what I thought was odd. Usually there is a special service for that,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt2"> like some sort of private company that ships animals about, for zoos or for horse races or something.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> So how did this happen?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Well as I said it was a mistake, the man didn't set out to post an otter.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"> What did the man set out to post instead?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> The man was an antique collector and trader. He often sent large crates and boxes about to clients and fellow collectors.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> And the otter climbed into one of these?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Yes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"> Wouldn't've he noticed an otter in the box? I mean they are pretty big, not like a rat or a hamster or some other type of rodent.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> And a collector as well, you'd think that such a person would have a keen eye.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> How did he miss it then?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 13</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt2"> Well he swears that it was living in this old bathtub.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> That just raises more questions.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> It had a lid.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> A bathtub with a lid?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> It was an antique.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> I don't think he wanted anything to fall in it.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"> I guess that makes sense. I mean if that was your livelihood you'd probably want to protect your products.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Yes, that makes sense.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> So it had a lid, and I assume this lid hid the otter, right?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 13</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt2"> Exactly. Because there was a lid on the bathtub the antique collector did not see the otter and accidentally posted it.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Hold on, where did the otter come from?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> The dam near his house I assume.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> And he knew there were otters about?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt2"> Well I mean its not like he was expecting an otter in his bathtub.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> To be honest I don't generally expect to find otters in my bathtub.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> The man did live near a dam as well.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Didn't he have doors or something to keep critters out of his storage?<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt2"> They have arms.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Otters can open doors?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> You'd be surprised at how dexterous an otter can be.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Was it a lever handle or something? I don't think an otter could use a knob.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt2"> That's what my girlfriend thinks too.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 13</a><div class="page-content"><span class="fmt5"> What?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Get it, otter... knob... Sex joke, haha!<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> I think you're thinking beaver.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> There is a difference?<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> Yeah, completely different animals dude.<span class="fmt0"></span></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 13</a><div class="page-content">
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt2"> Well fuck.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt5"> <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt5"> You're an idiot.</div></div>
