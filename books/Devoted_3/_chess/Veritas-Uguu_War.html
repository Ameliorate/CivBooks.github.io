<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Their reason for doing this stemmed from the actions of an old group, The Pirates, in the last map, who managed to prolong</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>When civcraft 3.0 ended, Aegis did not migrate to Devoted like mostly everyone else did. However, a lot of their players created their own much</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Veritas disagreed with Uguu's policing of the server, saying it was unfair to pearl a new player for their actions on another server. However, another reason Veritas disagreed was because Uguu were targetting and killing</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Although Veritas did not aid the players once they had begun raiding, the raiders had got most of their valuable armor from Veritas before they started</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It did not help that HiImPosey was pearled by Uguu for breaking a vault containing raiders that Uguu had caught. Veritas</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Outside of the game, a lot of talks about breaking Posey out of the vault commenced, some talks with the</div></div>

Due to permissions on the discord being set wrong and an invite link being abused, Veritas' supposedly private chats were leaked to the entire server by Uguu.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, it is questionable whether or not this leaks were actually</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 36</a><div class="page-content">incriminating.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>As time progressed, the tension, at least in Veritas, increased.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 36</a><div class="page-content">We became certain that at some point, we would be attacked and started to prepare for the worst. There were several reasons for this:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One Uguu player, poortea, with a history of trespassing in Veritas land attacked Coni_s2 on the border of the nations</div></div>

Veritas placed a bounty of 128d on poortea, and AdminCrimes - still Uguu leader - handed in the pearl himself. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>A week or so later, again at the border of the nations, Coni_s2 was</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>It seemed like the peaceful period was about to end for the two nations, and Veritas kept hearing rumours that Uguu were about to attack their vault</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 36</a><div class="page-content">at "the end of the month," "on thanksgiving," and "on the day after thanksgiving."<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>However, one major turning point was when Uguu's private discord was leaked this time, revealing their plans to attack Veritas on the 25th of November 2016.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 36</a><div class="page-content">Uguu claimed the server was dying, due to it's exhaustive tech tree and increasing boredom with not being able to progress upon it.

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>These leaks were posted on the 25th of November 2016, an hour before the given attack time, and gave most of the server time to help the side they thought were in the right.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The attack was delayed</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Eventually, at around 4:30pm EST, the Uguu forces, their allies, and their supporters marched on Veritas in their attempt to break the vault, and to deplete Veritas of all it's stored valuables, wiping out the nation and their main threat on</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The war started quickly, and soon many players from both sides were pearled, with Veritas holding 6 pearls and Uguu holding 4 at the end of the first assault. <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One of Veritas' best fighters, Reiko, was pearled when he lagged out during a fight. Although some Veritas members claimed this was a DDOS attack on</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Later, Uguu attacked again in full force, pearling 5 more players whilst barely losing any.</div></div>
