<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The Spiral Confederacy's claim spans roughly 2700m from east to west and 1500m from north to south. It is extremely sparsely developed. I personally</div></div>

Having walked their entire district, dug and searched near landmarks, tried</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 16</a><div class="page-content">to break walls and enter locked doors, I can say that I would have triggered any and every snitch that they would have had. I absolutely would have drawn attention to myself when I wanted <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>to...but<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span> I got nothing. No words of warning, no attacks, no</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 16</a><div class="page-content">response at all. This fact, along with the lack of buildings, brings me to a few possible conclusions:<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>1) The S.C. reside mostly underground, in one of the dozens of naturally occuring caves/holes that sprinkle their land.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 16</a><div class="page-content">2) The S.C. are simply very inactive players and none of them were online at all over the whole time I was there (7-8 days). <span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>3) They are so extremely cautious that not only do they potentially live below ground, but they do not</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 16</a><div class="page-content">respond to intruders or potential griefers. I even grew wheat on some of the abandoned farms/villages that I found and came back later to harvest it on several occasions. This third option may also indicate they lack the numbers, strength or experience</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 16</a><div class="page-content">to confront aggressors.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>Every farm and village that I found was long abandoned. They were even empty of villagers except for one, and that one was so long forgotten that it had villagers trapped in holes from creepers. Every tunnel</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 16</a><div class="page-content">and cave that I found that looked manmade, I explored as best as I could. None had any sign of being explored by others deeper than a few dozen meters. I found evidence of two mines, both were incomplete, empty, and long abandoned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>One in the north of the claim (-2159, 2157). One at the south of the claim (-1940, 3230). One at the west of the claim (-3133, 2715).</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 16</a><div class="page-content">Lastly there is the FRP (-2258, 2485), a fenced-in area where someone appears to have been growing trees at one point, but it also seemed abandoned.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The first three mentioned here are the only areas that had locked doors or</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>This is a very diverse claim in terms of biomes. There are</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 16</a><div class="page-content">high mountains that border the easternmost edge. The middle is vast plains and hills dotted with natural caverns and holes. The claim is split by four large rivers that all meet inside the Clearwater plot in the middle. To the west there is desert, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 16</a><div class="page-content">along the southeastern border there is tundra. There were many places that would be perfect for farming and building a community with ample room for livestock and easy landscape for defense, but there was no sign of development.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>If we were to move against the S.C. we would be going into a large, barely-developed claim that very well could hide bases under the ground. I found dozens of caves, holes, and crevasses and</div></div>
