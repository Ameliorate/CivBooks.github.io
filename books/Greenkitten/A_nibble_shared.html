<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 14</a><div class="page-content">"Here comes the aeroplane..." Said Micky to his soon to be fiance, Jane. Making swooping motions with his spoon towards her lips.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Jane obliged, opening her mouth to recieve the food. This infantile behaviour was to be expected, Micky was quite juvenile.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 14</a><div class="page-content">This wasn't a bad thing often thought Jane, Micky would make a fun and loving father one day. This silliness was a great fun too. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">As the eating utensil left her mouth Jane displayed a pensive look across her face. Micky though was unaware of this,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 14</a><div class="page-content">he continued to take another scoop and proceeded to get himself a mouthful of the meal.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Micky," Jane said with a serious tone in her voice, "When are you going to make me an honest woman?"<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Micky gagged, the sudden question took</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 14</a><div class="page-content">him by surprise. Coughin and spluttering Micky's response was short and deflecting, "W-what?" followed by a few taps on the chest to try clear his throat. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Jane, ever so caring gave Micky a few good whacks on the back to help him out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 14</a><div class="page-content">After regaining his composure Jane repeated the question which lead to the sudden reaction. "Micky, why have you not proposed to me yet?"<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Micky was still taken aback by this question. He didn't have a good answer for this. It was only a matter of time</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 14</a><div class="page-content">until this question popped up. And the truth was Micky was just too scared to pop the question, he had in fact been carrying a ring around in his pocket for almost a year now but has never worked up the courage to ask. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Jane knew this though, she had a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 14</a><div class="page-content">feeling that this was the case but had tried to be patient with Micky, knowing that he had a certain awkwardness to this kind of thing. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Jane," departing from his usual silly tone, "Will you marry me?" <span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Micky finally produced the ring that had so</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 14</a><div class="page-content">long been kept in his pocket.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Tears of joy welled up in Jane's tearducts the day she had been dreaming of had arrived. All the fantasies she had about her wedding day were about to come true...</div></div>
