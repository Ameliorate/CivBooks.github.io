<span class="fmt0">Desperate to earn his way into the Kool Kek Klan<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Sitting on the ground he thought mighty hard<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Writing, in his book, a little bard<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Thats when an idea came into his head</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 5</a><div class="page-content">One that would make all the Redditors plea to be dead<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He dipped his pen in ink and took a glance<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Hoping that this would be the Channer's best chance<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">He began writing and smiling with glee<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">He stood in the field for minutes 10 times 3</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 5</a><div class="page-content">When he was done he looked around<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Noticed that the entire time he made no sound<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">He looked down at his book and scratched his neck<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Signed his book as The Gospel of Kek<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The word of Kek brought Redditors fear<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">All of which refused to come near</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">I would one day love to shake his hand<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The man was quiet and somewhat odd<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">That man's name is Pkeod</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 5</a><div class="page-content">In honor of Pkeod<span class="fmt0"></span>
