The founding fathers of the Great Chanadian Confederacy on Devoted 3.0. These names have long been forgotten since a few weeks after the nation's founding. They were the roots of the grand</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">The Chan people gather on yet another civilization server to destroy reddit with a secondary objective of conquering the -,- quadrant. They began to build and founded</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 33</a><div class="page-content">what was then know as Chancer, the capital of Chanada. Channers from many different boards arrived from different areas of the world, all of which played in different timezones. Progress is made and many have great feelings about the new nation.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 33</a><div class="page-content">However, during the first week, infighting between the Channers had begun. Many would bicker for hours about all sorts of nonsense. Many broke off to start their own towns. This is where our "official" history begins. The founding of Polynesia (/pol/town)</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 33</a><div class="page-content">as well as the founding of Marienburg. Shadowedsoul headed to the east with Kebabremover1997 to build a socialist town that was strictly reserved for those recruited off of the /pol/ board on 4chan. Meanwhile, Southernbloc headed not too far south to form</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Marienburg. This is where I come in. Southernbloc recruited me and i hopped onto the server immediately. Marienburg and /pol/town had slow progress at this point. During this time, kovio headed to the snowy north where he/she (idfk) started to build</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Ushanka (Katyusha). The nation was divided into 4. We all cooperated with each other and were friendly, but in a way, we were all independant. Technically all the towns could've been viewed as different states. This point is where kovio vanishes.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">Progress is still slow for our struggling nation. We have a low and divided population. Many thought of leaving due to the lack of action. However, action came a few hours later. /pol/ seemed to have some issues with a few</div></div>

A small civil war broke out that lasted about a day. Karadzic and others called it "Autismos." /pol/town won and chased the leftys away. They went off to what is now</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 33</a><div class="page-content">known as the USR. While the nation was in small chaos, it did not stop us from growing. More people were shilled and our numbers multiplied. Marienburg and Chancer cooperated as if they were 1 town. Who knows how Ushanka was doing? Nobody. Kovio would</div></div>

Doesn't matter if you were part of Chanada. They looked for ever excuse to try to pearl people. So we stayed away. Katyusha lived in isolation for the longest time. Nothing was known of their progress.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">A new town has emerged in our beloved nation. TG Town has sprung up with Bob_Namg as its leader.  Nothing else seems to have happened during this week. Every town progressed other than Chancer. It was failing.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">The downfall of Chancer has finally come with the last remaining citizens scattering to join Marienburg, TG Town, or Polynesia. Some even left the nation, claiming that it was doomed to fail just like Chancer. With the failing of</div></div>

It seems that without Chancer as the capital, Chanada came into its Golden Age. The peak of our empire. Over the next few days our numbers tripled! We had somewhere around 40+</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 33</a><div class="page-content">players wandering about at different times. We had about 1/3 of the total server population in our nation. Times were good. Food and Materials were plenty throughout the lands. We were the most powerful nation on the server. Thus was the end of month 1.</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">Katyusha has fallen silent over the past few days. It appeared as if nothing interesting was going to happen any time soon. Thats where we were wrong. Sir Saren_Solaris swooped in on Marienburg and bombed it to hell. We were</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 33</a><div class="page-content">absolutely shocked! How could anyone do something like that to a peaceful town full of buildfags? We thought nothing of it. Just a raider coming in to grief us. But it happened for a second time. The people of Marienburg were furious! They wanted revenge!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 33</a><div class="page-content">They wanted Saren's blood to be spilled into the Grand Canal. So we thought of a trick. After Saren had a change in heart and he started to make videos, we thought of a plan. We would invite him to record a video and at the end, we would pearl him.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It was perfect. A master plan that took days to prepare for. The day finally came. It took hours to record the video. At the end, it was all worth it. Karadzic whipped out his big, straight, solid diamond axe and split Saren's skull in 2.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 33</a><div class="page-content">The poor camera man was pearled. Alas! Justice has been brought for Marienburg. We made him pay reps to us over the course of 2 weeks. He mined a DC of end stone and in the process began to colonize the end. That started a shit stir when others came and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 33</a><div class="page-content">wanted to take over. People like poortea (get cucked stupid nigger lmao) came to the end and started to kill and raid. But we had a good laugh and called it a day. A week later we held the famous Saren Trials in Marienburg. Saren_Solaris was put on trial</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 33</a><div class="page-content">and was charged with full responsibility of bombing Marienburg. It was a whole meme though and it was great. We recorded a video and had a nice drink in the beer hall where Saren got intimate with our polar bear, Otto von Bismarck. Month 2 was good tbh.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Month 3 of Devoted 3.0<span class="fmt0"></span>

<span class="fmt0">November is where things start to really get interesting. The World Police was going around and raiding innocent towns and people. Everyone is worried that we will be next. They were right. When polcastle decided to annex the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Faroe Islands just south of our claims, the WP came and destroyed polcastle along with all of its residents. They claimed to have raided it due to the fact that they were "harboring raiders" in bunkers. They were just using it as a lame excuse.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 33</a><div class="page-content">They also used the excuse that they were coming in the help the Faroe Islands. This event sparked the First Server War against the WP. Many nations came to us, begging for us to help them. We formed many alliances and made plans.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 33</a><div class="page-content">While the WP was distracted in other parts of the world, we decided to start preparing for war! Saren_Solaris and his crew found refuge in the peaceful Chanadian town of Marienburg. Quite ironic isnt it?</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 33</a><div class="page-content">First Saren goes to bomb the place, then returns to work for us and live in the very town he terrorized. For 2-3 weeks we grinded in Marienburg. Prot IV armor and weapons were flowing out of our workshops like water flows through a river!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Saren was in charge of making potions and planning the offensive. Many people were in the town at the same time; All of which were doing something to help the war effort. Then, the time finally came. The strike force was ready.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 33</a><div class="page-content">We collaborated with Veritas and supplied them with the potions, weapons, and armor required for such a large scale attack. It seemed like it ended too shortly. Within the next few days, all of the WP members had been pearled.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 33</a><div class="page-content">It seemed almost too easy! We had won! The server was free from their reign of terror. Every nation in devoted began celebrations and congratulating Veritas on their victory and their success. What many people dont know is,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Chanada had played a major role in this. If it wasnt for us, Veritas would have fallen. All of the server would have most likely quit. It was a great day for Devoted and a great day for Chanada. We were at peace and it felt good.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 33</a><div class="page-content">In honor of those who are no longer with our Chan community. Long live Chanada!<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 33</a><div class="page-content">Part 2 coming out soon! Hopefully by mid May. Right now its December 31st and we need some time and history to play out before we can write a new book. Till next time!</div></div>
