I was incredible...
    I was able to clear distances with such speed! Such Grace!
    "A fast Sherson? Incredible!" A fast Sherson, you might ask.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 8</a><div class="page-content">    Indeed I was fast... very fast. But I slowly started to... slow. I could feel myself... dying...
    This was a bit before I fully understood english, "Bahhhhh!!!", I said. But, as the Pigmen were to me, I was to the People... An abomination...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 8</a><div class="page-content">    I slowly regained my balance, and floricked back to Columbia, forever changed. I got some blaze rods off of jacejace... for "potions".
    I developed a might lab in my basement. Not far from my developing cow herd.      Anyway, I started</div></div>

    Speed. Not the speed the Nether Abominations gave me though. It was a shorter high...</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 8</a><div class="page-content">much more intense, though. My speed was only seconded to those cruel beings, Endermen.
    "Jack's Special Shit" I called it. I could have thought of a better name, but I think it was the Speed talking. This potion...
this poison... made me
feel great!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 8</a><div class="page-content">    I could run circles around any human. After every minute, though... it ended, and so came the gut-wrenching pain.
    During this moment of pain, I could not scream. What I could do, though, was speak my own language. A dead language now,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 8</a><div class="page-content">that even I forget at points. Sherplish...
    Many mock it. Sheep are often misunder-
stood. "Bahhhh" is not our restriction.
