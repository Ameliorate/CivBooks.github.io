<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Socialism, as a broad set of philosophies, also contains the basic premise of equality. It most basically advances a democratic economy, as opposed to one in which people are born into stations and there are some with riches while others starve.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 47</a><div class="page-content">This isn't to say that other kinds of socialism are nondemocratic, it just denotes the democratic state. There is much diversity in the specifics, with a heavily decentralized state (much more local control) being popular originally</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The means of production are either owned by the workers, in collectives, in which every worker has equal stake in all decisions, or by the state, in trust for the people, or a mixture of both.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 47</a><div class="page-content">Means of gaining control range from winning an electoral victory in an already established parliamentary/republican system or coming to power by popular revolution.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The state in democratic socialism exists to organize communal efforts and provide for the needs of the citizen, leading to terms like "socialized medicine."</div></div>

However there have been powerful states controlled by communists. This has to do with the different kinds of communists and the different ways they operate</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 47</a><div class="page-content">All communists purport to be acting for the same end goal: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need."</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 47</a><div class="page-content">In Marxist theory, different types of societies represent different classes in charge; feudalism is ruled by the nobility, who control the land, capitalism is ruled by the bourgeoisie, the capital-owners, who control the land and factories, and socialism-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 47</a><div class="page-content">-  is ruled by the proletariat, those who had to sell their labor under capitalism.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 47</a><div class="page-content">The end goal, described by Marx as "historically inevitable," is communism, in which there are no classes at all, as everything is owned collectively.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 47</a><div class="page-content">As Marx found this progression necessary, the period of a classless society must be preceded by a period in which society is controlled by the proletariat, which is often follow by violent revolution.</div></div>

<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 47</a><div class="page-content">not a "dictatorship" in the sense of one person or a small group in charge.

<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 47</a><div class="page-content"> Lenin held that it was important for the workers to ally with other oppressed groups in society in the initial revolution. He demonstrated this idea himself the next year in the Russian Revolution of 1917</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 47</a><div class="page-content">In practice, Leninism treats the dictatorship of the proletariat as the control of the state by a vanguard party, a group of "professional revolutionaries" who reorder society on behalf of (and theoretically as a part of) the proletariat.</div></div>
