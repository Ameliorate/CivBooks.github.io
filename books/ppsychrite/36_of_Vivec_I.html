Ayem came first to the village of the netchimen, and her shadow was that of Boethiah, who was the Prince of Plots, and things unknown and known would fold</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">'I am the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. In you is an image and a seven-syllable spell, AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK, which you will</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 12</a><div class="page-content">repeat to it until mystery comes.'<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Then Ayem threw the netchiman's wife into the ocean water where dreughs took her into castles of glass and coral. They gifted the netchiman's wife with gills and milk fingers, changing her sex so that she might give</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Then Seht came to the netchiman's wife and said:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">'I am the Clockwork King of the Three in One. In you is an egg of my brother-sister, who possesses</div></div>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And Seht then extended his hands and multitudes of homunculi came forth, each like a glimmering rope through the water, and they raised the netchiman's wife</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 12</a><div class="page-content">back to the surface world and set her down on the shoals of Azura's coast. There she lay for seven or eight more months, caring for the edgg-knowledge by whispering to it the Codes of Mephala and the prophecies of Veloth and even the forbidden teachings</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 12</a><div class="page-content">of Trinimac.<span class="fmt0"></span>

<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">'Whom do you wait for?'<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>

I return now to haunt the warriors who fell and still wonder why. But first I show you this.'<span class="fmt0"></span>

<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 12</a><div class="page-content">'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me. Love is under my will only.'<span class="fmt0"></span>
