The weak and degenerate bourgeoisie in Asia, Latin America and Africa is too dependent on foreign capital and imperialism, to carry society forward. It is tied with a thousand threads, not only to foreign capital, but with the class of</div></div>

Only the proletariat, allied with the poor peasants and urban poor, can solve the problems of society by taking power into its own hands, expropriating the imperialists and the bourgeoisie, and beginning the task of transforming society on</div></div>

By setting itself at the head of the nation, leading the oppressed layers of society (urban and rural petty-bourgeoisie), the proletariat could take power and then carry through the tasks of the bourgeois-democr</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 35</a><div class="page-content">atic revolution (mainly the land reform and the unification and liberation of the country from foreign domination). However, once having come to power, the proletariat would not stop there but would start to implement socialist measures of expropriation</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 35</a><div class="page-content">of the capitalists. And as these tasks cannot be solved in one country alone, especially not in a backward country, this would be the beginning of the world revolution. Thus the revolution is "permanent" in two senses: because it starts with the</div></div>

The theory of the permanent revolution was the most complete answer to the reformist and class collaborationist</div></div>

The two stage theory was developed by the Mensheviks as their perspective for the Russian revolution. It basically states that, since the tasks of the revolution are those of</div></div>

Following in the footsteps of Marx, who had described the bourgeois "democratic</div></div>

What class, in Lenin's view, could lead the bourgeois-democratic revolution? "There remains 'the people', that is, the proletariat and the peasantry. The proletariat alone can be relied on to march on to the</div></div>

In all of Lenin's speeches and writings, the counter-revolutionary role of the bourgeois-democratic Liberals is stressed time and time again. However, up until 1917, he did not believe that the</div></div>

Had the Communist International remained firm on the positions of Lenin and Trotsky, the victory of the world</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 35</a><div class="page-content">revolution would have been ensured.
