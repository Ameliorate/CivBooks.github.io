<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"Quick, husband! We must get to the clinic before it's too late!", said the lady. Her name was Mary-Ann Baker. She was fifty-three. Her tits were massive, almost as big as her bulging belly. Pus oozed from her unpleasantly brown eyes,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 15</a><div class="page-content">her hairy nostrils, her wrinkled ears and her vulgar mouth. All sixty-seven of her hairs were died back in a ponytail. She was a natural brunette, but since her hair was the exact shade of a mouse's fur she had dyed it a bright blond.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 15</a><div class="page-content">"I'm driving as fast as I can, dear. But I cannot simply ignore the traffic lights, you know that! Law and order must be preserved", her husband answered. His name was Geodfrey Baker ; he was a schoolteacher. He was also a nervous man, skinny, frail,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 15</a><div class="page-content">sickly. He was nothing like his wife, and many wondered how the two had ever gotten together. They were polar opposites in a myriad of respects, but most conspicuous of all was the difference in their sexual appetites. Geodfrey hat not touched a woman</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 15</a><div class="page-content">until the age of thirty-three ; on the other hand, Mary-Ann was known throughout the South for being a unimaginably voracious, promiscuous and lustful slattern, unmatched by any other woman that side of Buckingham Palace. Most men in Mrs. Baker's</div></div>

It was said that the prodigious size of Mary-Ann's ventral protuberance could not simply be explained by her incredible obesity - indeed when her mouth wasn't occupied pleasuring that hour's lover, it was munching on a</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 15</a><div class="page-content">deep-fried stick of butter or a bacon triple cheeseburger - no, the size of her tummy was also due to dozens, perhaps hundreds of foetuses and embryos at various stages of development, from a host of different fathers - none of them Mr. Baker.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 15</a><div class="page-content">So numerous and cramped where these developing humanoids that her network of uteri had begun to resemble a plague of pimples, both in size and in content. And one of the pimples was about to burst.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>"We have to go now, it's moving!", screamed Mrs. Baker</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 15</a><div class="page-content">at the top of her lungs. Their chariot flew effortlessly along the pavement, its flight akin to that of the majestic chicken. It was an antique barrow, hewn from wood and nails and it was pulled by two mules. "We're there, honey!</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 15</a><div class="page-content">It's going to be alright". They pulled over in front of the clinic and Geodfrey helped his wife off the cart.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span>The receptionist smiled at them. She recognised Mrs. Baker from all the other times."I'm afraid Mr. Bortum isn't here today. I can schedule</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 15</a><div class="page-content">an appointment for tomorrow if you'd like". Geodfrey's face was presently as pale as his bollocks. "We need it today! It's about to come out!" As if to prove his point, Mrs. Baker let out a scream of pain. Her abdomen began to pulsate. "I can perform it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 15</a><div class="page-content">for you now", offered the receptionist. "I'm qualified". "Please!", begged Geodfrey. She took out a coat hanger from behind her desk and got to work. She managed to get the baby right in the head, and she pulled. After a long battle, she wrestled it out -</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 15</a><div class="page-content">and out it came, writhing, clear white liquid oozing from its contracting and decontracting pores, its tiny little mouth emitting a plea, his first irritating, bitchy whine - it was alive, horribly alive. The dark-green slug fell on the floor.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 15</a><div class="page-content">"Oh no", murmured Mrs. Baker.<span class="fmt0"><span class="fmtcode">§0</span></span>
