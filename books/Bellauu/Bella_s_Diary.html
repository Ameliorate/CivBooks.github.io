<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 50</a><div class="page-content">We sat around the Denali’s kitchen table.  Eleazar sat next to Carmen as Edward sat next to me.  There were about twenty that still remained. Kate and Garrett were on their honeymoon, but the rest of the Denalis, the Cullens, Zafrina, Benjamin, Peter, and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Charlotte, were still there. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Since becoming a vampire, Jacob, Renesmee, and I were learning about various histories and vampire lore at the same rate.  It felt a little funny to be on the same learning curve as my daughter, but she always posed very</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 50</a><div class="page-content">intelligent questions. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Renesmee was currently very curious about the Volturi.  Even though they had come to take her life, she was not affected by this in a negative way.    She was able to let things go in a way that I wasn’t.  Edward had once told me</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> that the Volturi were not supposed to be the villains as I saw them.   I’d only had three encounters with them.   I didn’t care what anyone else said or believed about them.  I would never trust them as long as I existed nor would I actively</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 50</a><div class="page-content">seek to be in their presence.  As long as they stayed out of my life, I would stay out of theirs. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Renesmee posed her questions to Eleazar, since he’d actually worked for the Volturi at one point. I was sure, as I’m sure she was, that Eleasar would’ve had</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 50</a><div class="page-content">a more active role with them.   By doing so, he would have earned a deeper place in their confidence than Carlisle would have.   I wasn’t entirely sure I wanted her to know everything, but at the same time, Jacob and I were hearing the same stories.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Maybe it was better that she hear the truth without any sugar coating. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I could tell that Edward was not comfortable with this at all.  He had always tried to protect me from too much information, knowing that the more information I had,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the more danger I seemed to put myself in. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I smiled to myself at this.  I wondered how much she would be like me in this respect.  Perhaps this trait would come back to haunt me, and I briefly thought of all the ways she could get herself into trouble.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I thought of the anxiety I’d put Edward, and even Jacob, through with some of my choices when I was still human.  Even though she was stronger than any human, she was still no match for the Volturi or any other vampire that wanted to hurt her, so I was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 50</a><div class="page-content">glad Jacob would always be at her side.  I considered speaking to her about this like-minded trait we shared when we were alone.  For now, I let her ask her questions. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Why do Jane and Alec like to hurt people?” she asked.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-12"><a href="#page-12" class="page-indicator">Page 12 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Eleazar sighed. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Their history goes back quite a ways,” he remarked.  “Marcus, Aro, Caius, and their wives formed the Volturi in roughly 300 B.C., but it wasn’t until about 1500 years later that they found Alec and Jane. The family was searching</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 50</a><div class="page-content">at the time for extra talent to help them secure their control over the vampire world.  By this time, they’d already acquired, Chelsea, Demetri, and most of the rest of their guard, but Aro knew they were still vulnerable.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He continually sought ways to strengthen their power.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“A vampire, named Jalen, was with them at the time.  He had a talent similar to my own and was used to find talent that would be useful to the Volturi guard around the world.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He came across a small town in Sicily.  It was widely known that the church was very suspicious of witchcraft, and Alec and Jane were less than subtle about their abilities.” <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">That brought me up short.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Wait,” I said, “are you saying that Jane and Alec had abilities before they were changed?” <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Yes,” he said, as he looked at me. “Most vampires with talents have some form of it before they change.  It’s usually very subtle, however, and hard to detect.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-17"><a href="#page-17" class="page-indicator">Page 17 of 50</a><div class="page-content">  It’s rare that abilities show themselves as strongly as yours did.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“What powers did they have?” asked Renesmee.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Jane and Alec were ten years old when Jalen found them,” he explained.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-18"><a href="#page-18" class="page-indicator">Page 18 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“He was posing as a refugee when he came to their town.  They were standing next to a riverbank with some other children who weren’t hiding the fact that they didn’t like Jane.  One of the boys knocked something out of her hands in true bully fashion.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-19"><a href="#page-19" class="page-indicator">Page 19 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Alec touched Jane’s arm, so she didn’t go after them. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“The children walked away from Jane and Alec under a series of trees.  Jane was said to have great anger in her eyes and looked straight at one of the branches that was sticking out.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-20"><a href="#page-20" class="page-indicator">Page 20 of 50</a><div class="page-content">It had a sharp enough edge that it could hurt someone if they fell on it.  The boy suddenly lunged himself towards it, seriously cutting his arm.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“The other children looked at Jane as she stared smugly at the injured boy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-21"><a href="#page-21" class="page-indicator">Page 21 of 50</a><div class="page-content">His arm never healed quite right and was never able to explain why he’d purposefully injured himself.  The town was already suspicious of them, but up until now, it had been nothing more than superstition as far as Jalen could tell.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-22"><a href="#page-22" class="page-indicator">Page 22 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“He took up a residence near the town and continued to watch them.  Being a vampire, he could watch and listen to them from a distance, so they never realized they were being watched.  After some time, it was clear to him that  he was, indeed, seeing</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-23"><a href="#page-23" class="page-indicator">Page 23 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> extra talents in them. <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Aro eventually confirmed Jalen’s suspicions, but because they were so young, Aro had planned to wait before changing them.  He visited the town frequently with Chelsea, helping to form a bond between himself and the twins.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-24"><a href="#page-24" class="page-indicator">Page 24 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“He warned them both about using their powers, but as you know, Jane not one for being controlled.  A few of the town’s people set up a trick of some kind making it look like Alec and Jane had done something.  Ironically, they were tried and convicted for</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-25"><a href="#page-25" class="page-indicator">Page 25 of 50</a><div class="page-content">something they didn’t do.  It angered Jane greatly.   Aro and Jalen happened to be away when they were first taken and tried. They were in the middle of receiving their sentence when Aro got to them.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“What do you mean?  They tried to burn</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-26"><a href="#page-26" class="page-indicator">Page 26 of 50</a><div class="page-content"> them at the stake?  Humans can’t survive that anymore than one of us could,” I pondered.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Eleazar nodded.  “Both Jane and Alec were in the middle of the flames when Aro got to them.  He was able to pull them out using his speed and strength.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-27"><a href="#page-27" class="page-indicator">Page 27 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Jane says he put them both on the ground and bit them hoping the venom would keep them alive. “<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“He did that all in front of the town’s people?” asked Jacob, who was just as dumbfounded as I was.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Eleazar nodded again.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-28"><a href="#page-28" class="page-indicator">Page 28 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“What about the secrecy clause of being a vampire?  I can’t see Aro ever doing anything to reveal himself like that,” I said.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He held up his finger to say, “Let me finish.”<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">All eyes in the room were glued to him as we listened to the story.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-29"><a href="#page-29" class="page-indicator">Page 29 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I quickly glanced around, and it was clear that I wasn’t the only one hearing this part for the first time.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Aro had already been around for 1500 years.  He knew a thing or two about the world and about the various technologies it had, primitive</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-30"><a href="#page-30" class="page-indicator">Page 30 of 50</a><div class="page-content">as they were.   He was not happy that he’d been forced to change them too soon.  He was livid actually, and after biting them, he used his knowledge of gunpowder to burn the town and everyone in it. His strength and speed, not to mention</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-31"><a href="#page-31" class="page-indicator">Page 31 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Jalen’s help, made it impossible for anyone to escape.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It took a few moments for all of this to sink in.  Finally, there was a question from Rosalie.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">“So Jane always had the power she has now?  Even before she was changed?”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-32"><a href="#page-32" class="page-indicator">Page 32 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Sort of,” explained Eleazar.   “It’s just a theory, but I think when people concentrate on things as they’re brought through, it manifests in their vampire physiology to some degree.  A large portion has to do with genetics,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-33"><a href="#page-33" class="page-indicator">Page 33 of 50</a><div class="page-content">of course, but some of it is about the mind.  The human brain only uses about ten percent of its capabilities, so if you add the enhancing power of vampire venom, you get increased mental capacities.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-34"><a href="#page-34" class="page-indicator">Page 34 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Carlisle glanced at me and smiled, and I knew what he was thinking too.  During my transformation, I had fought so hard for control.  I never went through that crazed stage that most newborns went through and there was debate as to</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-35"><a href="#page-35" class="page-indicator">Page 35 of 50</a><div class="page-content">whether that was a supernatural talent or a product of my preparation.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“When Aro first asked me to search for potential guard members, I was curious about the others in the group with powers.   I spoke to Jane and Alec once about their</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-36"><a href="#page-36" class="page-indicator">Page 36 of 50</a><div class="page-content">transformation, and she told me that the whole time she was burning, both on the stake and during her change, all she could think about was manipulating everyone’s mind to feel the same pain that she was feeling.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-37"><a href="#page-37" class="page-indicator">Page 37 of 50</a><div class="page-content">Alec on the other hand was thinking of nothing but the relief of pain.  He could see the town burning near them and knew the pain they were all in.  That’s not to say that he wasn’t angry. He was furious, but he kept thinking</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-38"><a href="#page-38" class="page-indicator">Page 38 of 50</a><div class="page-content">that even if he could make them all not realize they were burning it would be enough.  Hence the two gifts they have today.” <span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“I feel bad for them,” said Renesmee.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Of course!  She saw past their monstrosities and felt sympathy.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-39"><a href="#page-39" class="page-indicator">Page 39 of 50</a><div class="page-content">That was very much in line with her character.   I didn’t quite see things that way.  I wanted her to always be as far away from Jane and Alec as possible.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was Emmett who spoke up next.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“So the next time we change someone,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-40"><a href="#page-40" class="page-indicator">Page 40 of 50</a><div class="page-content">we just tell them to think of a really cool power the whole time, and they’ll have it when they wake up?” he asked incredulously.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Everyone laughed.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">“It doesn’t work like that,” answered Eleazar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-41"><a href="#page-41" class="page-indicator">Page 41 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Powers don’t seem to be created, but rather enhanced, during the change.  So unless someone is born with the trait you’re looking for, they won’t have it after.  Jane and Alec were born with traits that were enhanced by their thoughts</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-42"><a href="#page-42" class="page-indicator">Page 42 of 50</a><div class="page-content">and the venom as they changed.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I sat there for a while, thinking about all I’d just heard.  It was interesting, and a little scary, to hear of the Volturi beginnings.  What a crazy world we lived in.  A new thought occurred to me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-43"><a href="#page-43" class="page-indicator">Page 43 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I looked at Edward.  “You know what this means don’t you?”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">He shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Angela really could be a witch.”<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span></div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-44"><a href="#page-44" class="page-indicator">Page 44 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He laughed.  “That’s right, team Switzerland.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Absolutely,” I giggled.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“I think you’ve got enough monsters to deal with,” he remarked.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I saw Jacob roll his eyes.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-45"><a href="#page-45" class="page-indicator">Page 45 of 50</a><div class="page-content">I looked at Renesmee who seemed to be deep in thought and oblivious to the joke I’d just made.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Renesmee, are you ok, honey?” I asked.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Yes, mommy,” she said, but she wasn’t looking at me.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-46"><a href="#page-46" class="page-indicator">Page 46 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Why isn’t Marcus married like the other two?”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">I looked at the clock.  It was way passed her bedtime.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“That story is actually about one hundred times more complicated than Jane’s and Alec’s,” said Eleazar.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-47"><a href="#page-47" class="page-indicator">Page 47 of 50</a><div class="page-content">“Why?” asked Renesmee.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Because I’m not entirely sure of the truth,” he told her. “I have my theories, but I can’t be sure.”“I, too, have some thoughts on that,” said Carlisle.  “It’s impossible not to overhear things when you’re with</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-48"><a href="#page-48" class="page-indicator">Page 48 of 50</a><div class="page-content">the Volturi, and I was there for quite a while.”<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Can we save this discussion for when Renesmee has slept?” I asked.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">Carlisle smiled. “Of course,” he said. Renesmee hugged everyone, and Edward and I took</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-49"><a href="#page-49" class="page-indicator">Page 49 of 50</a><div class="page-content">her to lie down.  We stayed with her until she was asleep.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Promise me you’ll tell me,” I said to Edward. “If these discussions give her nightmares or something, I want to know.  I think if we tried to hide it from her, she’d find out anyways.”</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-50"><a href="#page-50" class="page-indicator">Page 50 of 50</a><div class="page-content">He smiled.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">“Yes, she is your daughter in that respect.  For now, she’s fine, and I’d rather us be aware of what she knows, if you know what I mean.”<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And I did.  I put her hand on my skin and took in her peaceful dreams for a while.</div></div>
