<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 6</a><div class="page-content">Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 6</a><div class="page-content">And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 6</a><div class="page-content">I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</div></div>
