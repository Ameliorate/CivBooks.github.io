In the dusk of the HCF menace CivCraft was quiet. Peace and players sprouted from dirt holes to rejoice in the crisp air of freedom. On this day of victory the city of Myra was born as a monument to the prosperity of</div></div>

Elsewhere all was not well. In the great dark power void the barbarians left in their wake a nervous discontent began to grow. It was among these turbulent shadows that a plan was hatched to reestablish the rule</div></div>

Historically CivCraft had relied on a nebulous group of players often reffered to as the "World Police" to preserve bountiful order. These ideologically conservative players had amassed great</div></div>

They believed their strength was evidence of the efficacy of their ideology. Moreover, they believed it burdened them with the duty of corralling the</div></div>

But the invasion had shone too bright a light on the World Police. Each in turn had fallen to the barbarian hordes, and both individually and collectively the world police had been</div></div>

In the dim twilight of the HCF presence they could still derive some power from the population's fear of another invasion, but their ability to repel one was widely doubted even amongst their</div></div>

Without an enemy the WP were without purpose or influence, their power having been derived not only from the players' need for protection but by confidence in the police's ability to provide it. In the darkness a new plan</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 17</a><div class="page-content">was hatched.

As libertarian conservatives the group was exposed to the ideas of Paul Wolfowitz, and to his success in empowering George Bush to command the masses. They saw how Wolfowitz wrangled the fear of terrorism to provide</div></div>

With their will to power firmly justified by their libertarian ideology a plan was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 17</a><div class="page-content">drawn up to use alternate accounts for acts of terrorism. This terror would provide the World Police with the enemy they needed to reassert their idea of order. 

In the way Wolfowitz's ideas would empower a second GB, now known as the gimmick</div></div>

Many innocents were killed and people began to ask once again who would protect them from the new menace. The path to victory seemed clear, and under banners of MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! the WP prepared to</div></div>

They would never claim that throne, however, the terrorists they conjured were too potent an enemy to be ignored. A small group of doubting "truthers" began to question the origins of the</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-13"><a href="#page-13" class="page-indicator">Page 13 of 17</a><div class="page-content">terrorists with shocking results. Evidence linking the terrorists to the patriotic network of Eagles pulled the string that would unwind their robe of lies to leave them standing nude before the public in a pile of bleeding madras.</div></div>
