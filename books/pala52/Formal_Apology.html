I'm not sure I feel bad for pearling first and asking questions later. The way the game is nowadays, we felt like it was better to have a hold of you first. What I really feel bad about is thinking you might have done something so bad.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 3</a><div class="page-content">You've been a standup guy so far, and I feel like maybe we should review our questioning/apprehension process, at least for "internal" people that, like I said, seem like standup people. Please accept this token of regret. Saw your armor was pretty banged</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 3</a><div class="page-content">up. Not sure if it was like that before, or if I did it, but heres replacement. Again, sorry for thinking you might be a bad guy. Hope I didn't ruin your day.</div></div>
