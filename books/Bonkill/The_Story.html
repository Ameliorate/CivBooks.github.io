<div class="signee">Signed by <a class="signee-name" href="../../index.html?search=:signee:Bonkill">Bonkill</a>

<div class="book">
<div class="page" id="page-1"><a href="#page-1" class="page-indicator">Page 1 of 4</a><div class="page-content">At first there was nothing.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Only a cosmic storm of duping and jajapvpers on a now dead server.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And then an idea popped into Bonkill's head.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">What if I made my own server, with sharding, and hookers.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-2"><a href="#page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 4</a><div class="page-content">And so it was done.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">It was called /r/Devoted, mainly because Bonkill had squated on that subreddit.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">But also because he wanted to make a happy place for autistic children to spend their lives on instead of going outside.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 4</a><div class="page-content">He asked his civ-dad ProgrammerDan to help him.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And so there was spigot.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And from that came Devoted 1.0 which everyone agrees was a silly experiment.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Then Devoted 2.0 launched.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 4</a><div class="page-content">It was much better and had less sharding.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">But it was just Devoted bro.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">And then, this world was born... and it was good.</div></div>
