<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 9</a><div class="page-content">To Do List: 
- Get all missing animals and plants. Mooshrooms can wait for nethertravel to come back up.
- Get an expansion.
- Generally improve the farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 9</a><div class="page-content">IMPORTANT:
Some fires have raged in the forest. We must look for ways to protect the farm. Other than that, someone broke into Solomoons house. It seems nothing was stolen, but we must be careful though.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-5"><a href="#page-5" class="page-indicator">Page 5 of 9</a><div class="page-content">It's very late. I had trouble finding ink around town. I have six now, so I should be fine. Hopefully we can get a large farm going and DeRafs fortified house up. I'd really like to be able to get a large area for the farm and castle.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-6"><a href="#page-6" class="page-indicator">Page 6 of 9</a><div class="page-content">We need to try and cut the city roads off so that they can't move past us. Then we basically own the land around us. But we can't be to blatant about that. 
Furthermore, our cow and chicken populations exploded with the new compounds.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 9</a><div class="page-content">Sheep are enjoying themselves in the old chicken pen. Their numbers have increased aswell. 

Pig remain an issue since we fail to find a second one. 

Other than that, we added three ocelots to the farm.</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 9</a><div class="page-content">I have made request for the new land. Hopefully the council will be able to answer these.</div></div>
