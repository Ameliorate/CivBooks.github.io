<span class="fmt0">In the morning of life came the good fairy with her basket, and said:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Here are the gifts. Take one, leave the others. And be wary, choose wisely; oh, choose wisely! for only one of them is valuable."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The gifts were five: Fame, Love, Riches,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-3"><a href="#page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Pleasure, Death.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">The youth said, eagerly:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"There is no need to consider"; and he chose Pleasure.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">He went out into the world and sought out the pleasures that youth delights in. But each in its turn was short-lived and disappointing, vain and empty; and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-4"><a href="#page-4" class="page-indicator">Page 4 of 20</a><div class="page-content">each, departing, mocked him. In the end he said: "These years I have wasted. If I could but choose again, I would choose wisely."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">2.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The fairy appeared, and said:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Four of the gifts remain. Choose once more; and oh, remember-time is</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">The man considered long, then chose Love; and did not mark the tears that rose in the fairy's eyes.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">After many, many years the man sat by a coffin, in an empty home. And he communed with himself, saying: "One by</div></div>

Desolation after desolation has swept over me; for each hour of happiness the treacherous trader, Love, has sold me I have paid a thousand hours of grief. Out of my</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-7"><a href="#page-7" class="page-indicator">Page 7 of 20</a><div class="page-content">heart of hearts I curse him."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">3."Choose again." It was the fairy speaking. "The years have taought you wisdom-surely it must be so. Three gifts remain. Only one of them has any worth-remember it, and choose warily."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The man reflected long, then chose</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-8"><a href="#page-8" class="page-indicator">Page 8 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Fame; and the fairy, sighing, went her way.<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">Years went by and she came again, and stood behind the man where he satsolitary in the fading day, thinking. And she knew his thought:<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"My name filled the world, and its praises were on every tongue, and it</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-9"><a href="#page-9" class="page-indicator">Page 9 of 20</a><div class="page-content">seemed well with me for a little while. How little a while it was! Then came envy; then detraction; then calumny; then hate; then persecution. Then derision, which is the beginning of the end. And last of all came pity, which is the funeral of fame. Oh,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-10"><a href="#page-10" class="page-indicator">Page 10 of 20</a><div class="page-content">the bitterness and misery of renown! target for mud in its prime, for contempt and compassion in its decay."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">4.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Choose yet again." It was the fairy's voice. "Two gifts remain. And do not despair. In there beginning there was but one that was precious,</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-11"><a href="#page-11" class="page-indicator">Page 11 of 20</a><div class="page-content">and it is still here."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Wealth-which is power! How blind I was!" said the man. "Now, at last, life will be worth the living. I will spend, squander, dazzle. These mockers and despisers will crawl in the dirt before me, and I will feed my hungry heart with</div></div>

I will have all luxuries, all joys, all enchantments of the spirit, allcontentments of the body that man holds dear. I will buy, buy, buy! deference, respect, esteem, worship-every pinchbeck grace of life the market of a trivial world can</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">Three short years went by, and a day came when the man sat shivering in a mean garret; and he was</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-14"><a href="#page-14" class="page-indicator">Page 14 of 20</a><div class="page-content">gnawing a dry crust and mumbling:<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Curse all the world's gifts, for mockeries and gilded lies! And miscalled, every one. They are not gifts, but merely lendings. Pleasure, Love, Fame, Riches: They are but temporary disguises for lasting realities-</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-15"><a href="#page-15" class="page-indicator">Page 15 of 20</a><div class="page-content">Pain, Grief, Shame, Poverty. The fairy said true; in all her store there was but one gift which was precious, only one that was not valueless. How poor and cheap and mean I know those others now to be, compared with that inestimable one, that dear and</div></div>
<div class="page" id="page-16"><a href="#page-16" class="page-indicator">Page 16 of 20</a><div class="page-content">sweet and kindly one, that steeps in dreamless and enduring sleep the pains that persecute the body, and the shames and griefs that eat the mind and heart. Bring it! I am weary, I would rest."<span class="fmt0"></span>
<span class="fmt0">5.<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">The fairy came, bringing again four of the gifts, but Death</div></div>

<span class="fmt0">"I gave it to a mother's pet, a little child. It was ignorant, but trusted me, asking me to choose for it. You did not ask me to choose."<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
<span class="fmt0">"Oh, miserable me! What is there left for me?"<span class="fmt0"></span></span>
