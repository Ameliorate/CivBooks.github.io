   sounds crazy, but one time while super drunk I threw red mushrooms, netherwart, and some cow eggs I had sitting around. I can't remember how </div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-2" id="page-2" class="page-indicator">Page 2 of 5</a><div class="page-content">long I cooked it for, maybe 14 minutes?

Yeah. 15 maybe.

Anyway, I can't remember how much of each I put in, because WOW it messed me up.

I think like uh... 2 dozen netherwart? Maybe half a dozen mushrooms and eggs.</div></div>
<div class="page"><a href="#page-3" id="page-3" class="page-indicator">Page 3 of 5</a><div class="page-content">Whatever. Anyway, i let that stuff cook down well, then distilled the hell out of it.

Let it age in some old cask I had sitting around for a few years.

The stuff that came out... </div></div>

Pure, madness. I was fucked for a week, seriously.

Don't make this stuff.
