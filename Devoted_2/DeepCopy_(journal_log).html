Today was the day. The day for scotch and whiskey. I could feel it.

Tried 30 wheat and 20 seeds, but something seemed wrong. Perhaps tomorrow....</div></div>

Eureka! I found it. The secret was parity and multiples of 8. Whoever designed this universe has a strange mind, to be sure.

Tried three portions of wheat and seeds, and the result... so good. So good.</div></div>

So frustrating. I can't seem to figure out this whiskey! It just doesn't seem to turn out right...</div></div>

I've got it. The balance is thirds. Whiskey, so good. Just enough seeds to balance the wheat without overpowering into scotch ... thirds. Who woulda thought?</div></div>
